abstract = {This paper analyses the distributive impacts of internal violent conflicts, in contrast to previous literature which has focused on the effects of inequality on conflict. We use cross-country panel data for the time period 1960–2014 to estimate war-related changes in income inequality. Our results indicate rising levels of inequality during war and especially in the early period of post-war reconstruction. The return of inequality to pre-war levels may take up to four decades after the end of conflict. However, we find that this rise in income inequality is not permanent. While inequality peaks around 5 years after the end of a conflict, it declines again to pre-war levels within the end of the first post-war period. Lagged effects of conflict and only subsequent adjustments of redistributive policies in the period of post-war reconstruction seem to be valid explanations for these patterns of inequality. A series of alternative specifications confirms the main findings of the analysis.},

abstract = {We address two questions on the effects of climate change for social instability. First, do droughts and their associated environmental impacts affect support for the use of violence? Second, do local-level formal and informal institutions moderate support for violence when and where droughts worsen? To answer these questions, we conducted a national survey of 1,400 Kenyans in 2014. Respondents were asked about patterns of rainfall and the presence of rules regulating natural resource use and access. Survey data are joined to spatially disaggregated observed rainfall trends. The survey uses endorsement experiments to elicit honest responses about support for using violence. There is some evidence of a direct, though limited, link between observed drought and violent attitudes. Certain local-level natural resource use rules have moderating effects on support for violence where drought is reported and precipitation is less frequent. This conditional and contextual effect is an important modification of overly simplistic narratives of universal climate change effects.},

Using novel household survey data from two conflict-affected regions in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, we study variation in the support for violence related to reported exposure to drought and resilience metrics. Using comprehensive multifaceted objective and subjective indicators of resilience, we find that less resilient respondents who report having experienced drought and associated losses are more likely to be supportive of the use of political violence. In contrast, our findings suggest that there is no general association between reporting drought exposure and support for violence.},

Oil-related grievances are viewed as a key variable driving resentment and antistate attitudes. However, the off-the-shelf measures of existing studies (oil exports, oil revenues per capita, etc.) measure dependence and richness, not grievances among the population. This article contributes to filling this gap. Relying on an original opinion poll from the conflict-ridden Niger Delta, the analysis shows that both rebel-pursued, collective grievances (unfair oil revenue distribution) and individual grievances (livelihood destruction due to oil production) make people support antistate violence. These results lend micro-level evidence to the grievance mechanism linking oil and (support for) rebellion.},

Integrating common arguments from the civil war literature with the political behavior tradition, this article argues that perceived political efficacy, a central component of the political opportunity structure, moderates the association between individual and group grievance and people's support for political violence. It represents a first individual-level test of the argument that perceived political opportunity structure and grievances combine to explain internal armed conflict. Using original survey data from Guatemala, Nepal, and Northern Ireland (2016), we find robust empirical evidence that support for violence increases with perceived grievance and decreases with political efficacy; and some evidence of an interaction between the two.},

These discussions almost always conceive of "Islam" in general terms, not clearly defining what is meant by Islamic religious faith. We engaged this debate by designing and conducting a large-scale public opinion survey in Pakistan that measures multiple elements of religiosity, allowing us to separately consider the relationship between support for militant organizations and (1) religious practice; (2) support for political Islam; and (3) "jihadism," which we define as a particular textual interpretation common to Islamist groups espousing violent political action. We also measured support for militant organizations using a novel form of an "endorsement experiment" that assessed attitudes toward specific groups without asking respondents about them directly. We find that neither religious practice nor support for political Islam is related to support for militant groups. However, Pakistanis who believe jihad is both an external militarized struggle and that it can be waged by individuals are more supportive of violent groups than those who believe it is an internal struggle for righteousness. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.},

Thus, to overcome inequalities it is necessary that individuals subjectively perceive them as unjust. This is an issue that is especially relevant in Chile, one of the first countries to experience neoliberalism in the 1970s. More than social inequalities as such, which are widely studied by Latin American sociology, this article analyzes social justice as a subjective judgment about inequalities. On the basis of the findings of an empirical game-based research project, the article examines the justice criteria used by ordinary people regarding differences between members of society. The authors argue that according to these subjective criteria, social justice refers to aspects that differ from neoliberal discourse about distributive justice based on equality of opportunity and that procedural justice is also key in ordinary discourses about social justice.},

The Israeli-Palestinian case provides an opportunity to explore the dynamics of resistance and violence and their relation to politics. The goal is to explain the contradictory reactions to the First and Second Intifada in order to analyze options for the future. The article argues that the First Intifada opened up political space for recognition and negotiations but since the Second Intifada there has been only violence, no politics. The First Intifada demarcated the borders of the Israeli state and the imagined Palestinian state, while the second blurred them. Palestinian resistance is in a catch: when it uses violence it is oppressed, and when it uses diplomatic negotiations it is ignored. Given the absence of recognized borders and the imbalance of power between Israelis and Palestinians, international intervention is required both in the form of pressure on Israel and in the form of peace troops. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

Una de las principales controversias del estallido social, trata un doble cuestionamiento: c{\'{o}}mo ha sido distribuida la riqueza nacional y la manera que se ha gobernado. Junto con ello, no es menor la persistencia sobre las pr{\'{a}}cticas etiquetadas de violencias que emergen a los actuales ciclos de conflicto social. Pues, se trata de un cuestionamiento sobre los modos en que se ejecutan y legitiman las violencias. No obstante, la violencia no es una cuesti{\'{o}}n puntual del estallido social, en tanto es posible sostener que que nuestras sociedades (chilena y latinoamericana) se constituyen y se reproducen en base a diversas formas de violencias (e.g., porcentaje de homicidios en el continente). Por lo tanto, es vital relevar cu{\'{a}}les, d{\'{o}}nde y c{\'{o}}mo operan dichas violencias. 


Un conjunto de violencias de raigambre hist{\'{o}}rica y cultural 
La denominada “violencia estructural” ha sido el significante encargado de movilizar causas y razones del estallido. Se trata del empobrecimiento sistem{\'{a}}tico de las poblaciones y la matriz cultural del racismo y el sexismo, imbricados a un clasicismo de corte supremacista. Esto que tambi{\'{e}}n en com{\'{u}}n en el resto de las sociedades latinoamericanas, dan vida y sentido a las formas de Estado y los modos cotidianos de relacionarse. Relevar c{\'{o}}mo la desigualdad econ{\'{o}}mica provoca una experiencia de vida espec{\'{i}}fica respecto de estar arrojado a relaciones de violencia (incluso morir), es algo a visibilizar por la investigaci{\'{o}}n. 


La legitimidad, el monopolio y las v{\'{i}}ctimas
El Estado por pretender mantener –v{\'{i}}a mandato legal– el orden p{\'{u}}blico, activa un doble cr{\'{i}}tica. Por un lado, la legitimidad y monopolio sobre el uso de la violencia queda en relativo suspenso, pues su la legitimidad de su proyecto pol{\'{i}}tico necesita cada cierto tiempo ser conquistada. Por otro lado, aquel uso leg{\'{i}}timo de la violencia tropieza con las fuerzas que impugnan su legitimidad, en tanto es el Estado, a trav{\'{e}}s de la fuerza p{\'{u}}blica, el actor que ha violado sistem{\'{a}}ticamente tanto las libertades c{\'{i}}vicas como los derechos humanos. No obstante, en este contexto, ¿no es el momento tambi{\'{e}}n para hablar de las “otras” violencias que aquejan a la sociedad chilena? 
La creciente militarizaci{\'{o}}n y ocupaci{\'{o}}n del territorio mapuche, los graves casos de fraude al fisco, y ahora las acciones de violencia “leg{\'{i}}tima”, profundizan la grieta y la distancia conflictiva entre polic{\'{i}}a y sociedad a un nivel en que la recuperaci{\'{o}}n de su buena valoraci{\'{o}}n ciudadana parece casi irremontable.},

annote = {Introducci{\'{o}}n
Los inicios del primer gobierno de Pi{\~{n}}era, estuvieron marcados por su identificaci{\'{o}}n con la idea de una nueva derecha, modernizada y alejada de los totalitarismos y de los atropellos a los derechos humanos (El Pa{\'{i}}s, 2010). Sin embargo, al decretar el estado de emergencia, la derecha pareci{\'{o}} reconectarse con su pasado autoritario. Esto entra en contradicci{\'{o}}n con la invitaci{\'{o}}n a observadores de la ONU y el Human Rights Watch, pues entra en sinton{\'{i}}a con la defensa de los DDHH. 
¿C{\'{o}}mo interpretar la ambivalencia de estas tomas de posici{\'{o}}n? ¿Podr{\'{i}}a explicarse por la existencia de dos derechas, un ala dura y otra moderada, que suelen ser plasmadas en la oposici{\'{o}}n entre los halcones, representantes de los poderes f{\'{a}}cticos y garantes del n{\'{u}}cleo identitario y las palomas, defensores de las instituciones pol{\'{i}}ticas y del proyecto de poder de la derecha (Macari, 2010, Bellolio, 2016)? ¿Aquellas dos derechas tendr{\'{i}}an una incidencia en la manera en que el estallido social o Primavera Chilena (Somma et al., 2020) ha sido gestionada por el gobierno?


La vuelta a los principios fundamentales: el orden y la autoridad
A grandes rasgos, dos momentos pueden ser distinguidos en la gesti{\'{o}}n de la Primavera Chilena: una fase reactiva inicial cr{\'{i}}tica, luego del incendio simult{\'{a}}neo de estaciones de metro, lo que condujo al presidente a decretar el estado de emergencia. Despu{\'{e}}s una segunda fase en el que el gobierno busc{\'{o}} avanzar en la normalizaci{\'{o}}n, sin efectos notorios sobre la disminuci{\'{o}}n de las movilizaciones.
La crisis no solo devel{\'{o}} diferentes posiciones al interior de la derecha, sino tambi{\'{e}}n reaviv{\'{o}} ciertos traumas asim{\'{e}}tricos del pasado. Mientras que la derecha vuelve al discurso del enemigo interno y de la seguridad nacional a trav{\'{e}}s del estamos en guerra, para la izquierda se reabre la llaga de las violaciones a los DDHH en dictadura. Bajo la defensa de los valores de libertad y democracia, la derecha pone en evidencia la influencia de su ala dura: la defensa del orden y la autoridad, junto a cierto modelo de desarrollo. 


Las trabas a la gesti{\'{o}}n: la crisis de las instituciones
La incapacidad de restablecer el orden se ha visto agravada por la violaci{\'{o}}n masiva a los DDHH. La estrategia de contenci{\'{o}}n ejecutada por Carabineros, con una autonom{\'{i}}a demasiado grande en relaci{\'{o}}n a la autoridad civil, solo tuvo por efecto ahondar la distancia entre ciudadanos y fuerzas de orden asimiladas al gobierno. No obstante, seg{\'{u}}n la {\'{u}}ltima encuesta del CEP (2019) los chilenos condenan masivamente el uso desproporcionado de la fuerza de parte de Carabineros, al igual que reprueban mayoritariamente el uso que ciertos grupos de manifestantes -la llamada primera l{\'{i}}nea (Claude, 2020)- hacen de la violencia.
El descr{\'{e}}dito del Congreso y de los partidos pol{\'{i}}tico, confluye en la baja valorizaci{\'{o}}n de la Agenda Social y la Agenda de Orden y Seguridad. En relaci{\'{o}}n a esta agenda, la derecha (gobierno, partidos y electorado) parece m{\'{a}}s bien hacer del restablecimiento del orden p{\'{u}}blico una prioridad, lo que no deja entrever la existencia de diferencias entre la derecha. No obstante, la din{\'{a}}mica de la crisis y el procesos constitucional, revelan la existencia de diferentes sensibilidades en la derecha, las cuales invitan a complejizar la dicotom{\'{i}}a entre los “halcones” y las “palomas”.


Una coalici{\'{o}}n de centro-derecha entre apertura y repliegue identitario 
Las se{\~{n}}ales contrarias al compromiso inicial entre los partidos pol{\'{i}}ticos por el restablecimiento del orden (i.e., por las acusaciones constitucionales de la izquierda) con el acuerdo transversal por la paz social y la nueva constituci{\'{o}}n, sumadas a las violencias urbanas, despertaron en la derecha el espectro de la Unidad Popular, fortaleciendo la opci{\'{o}}n del rechazo a una nueva constituci{\'{o}}n. En este sentido, la crisis devel{\'{o}} la existencia de dos posiciones en la derecha. La primera, en la que el 79% de la UDI y el 65% de RN se declaran contrarios al establecimiento de una nueva Constituci{\'{o}}n, mientras que solo un 39% de Ev{\'{o}}poli expresaba su desacuerdo con ese cambio, confirmando la existencia en el conglomerado de una nueva derecha disociada de la herencia pinochetista (Alenda et al., 2020b). La segunda, re{\'{u}}ne a un grupo importante de cuadros dirigentes (e.g., alcaldes) pero tambi{\'{e}}n ciertas figuras clave de la coalici{\'{o}}n presentes incluso en las formaciones pol{\'{i}}ticas que se inclinan institucionalmente por el No (e.g., Lav{\'{i}}n, Ossand{\'{o}}n, Desbordes). 
M{\'{a}}s que la existencia de halcones y palomas, que se diferenciar{\'{i}}an por su relaci{\'{o}}n con las instituciones democr{\'{a}}ticas, la centro-derecha actual encierra sensibilidades unas m{\'{a}}s garantes del n{\'{u}}cleo duro identitario que otras.},

abstract = {The massive protests that exploded in Chile in October 2019 have left the country reeling from shock. The extensive participation of the population in demonstrations in Santiago and in all regional capitals, as well as the exceptional degree of violence and destruction that accompanied them, prompted President Pi{\~{n}}era to declare a state of emergency that lasted for nine days, put the military on the streets and imposed a curfew. This has left many international observers wondering what went wrong in a country that has often been held up by mainstream opinion as the poster child to other Latin America countries. Relatively high growth rates have been accompanied by sharp declines in poverty, steady improvements in educational outcomes, and even recent declines in inequality 1-all in the context of a relatively high-functioning democracy. The question emerges whether these protests are an exceptional occurrence limited to the context of Chile, or whether they are an indication of a more widespread malaise in one of the world's most unequal regions. In this article, we argue that the eruption of the social protests observed since October 2019 should not have surprised any close observer of Chile; in fact, they are paralleled by other protests in the region, such as in Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia. However, the degree of violence, looting and incendiary attacks on metro stations, supermarkets, pharmacies and other businesses were indeed unexpected, as was the extent of human rights violations resulting from the response of the police and armed forces to the disturbances. From Evading the Metro Fare to a Constitutional Debate: The Events as they Unfolded On 4 October 2019, the Chilean government announced a slight increase in metro fares. Rather unexpectedly, high school students spontaneously began to protest, took over metro stations, confronted the police and called for people to avoid paying the fares. On October 18, protests suddenly escalated. Hooligans joined in and violence spread. Approximately half of Santiago's metro stations were under siege and damaged. Twenty were set on fire and completely burned out. The violence spread to the streets where hooligans vandalised or looted supermarkets, pharmacies, banks and other businesses while further damaging public infrastructure. The chaos prompted the government to close down the entire metro system, leaving passengers stranded and forcing them to spend hours walking home. The following day, shocked by the scale of the destruction, President 1 Inequality as measured by household surveys in Chile has declined during the last decade. Initial studies using tax data, however, show that it has not (Flores et al., 2019).},

While it has sometimes been pushed to the margins of sociology, nevertheless, violence emerges repeatedly in the analysis of both everyday life and momentous social change; interpersonal relations and crime; governance and resistance; relations between states, north and south; and multiple varieties of modernity. New ways of making violence visible unsettle old notions of the nature and direction of violence; challenging assumptions that the disadvantaged are more violent than the powerful; and that modernity is increasingly less violent. The new research on violence against women and minorities and in the global South makes a powerful case for the inclusion of violence as a core issue in sociology. This article introduces the articles in this monograph issue of Current Sociology, situating them in a new paradigm of 'violence and society'. The articles identify the specificities of violence, its non-reducibility to state, culture and biology, while outlining the interconnections within this emerging field. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

At the same time, social movements sometimes attract participants with different temperaments and different views on the morality or utility of using violence against police. Moreover, the use of force or procedurally unjust tactics by police may influence these views, instigating rebellion and support for the use of violence against police by protesters. This paper examines the nature and correlates of attitudes toward using violence against police among Occupy DC participants in Washington, DC. Data are drawn from a survey of 136 Occupy DC participants. We provide descriptive statistics that summarise Occupiers' attitudes toward the use of violence against police, and test hypotheses about factors that may be associated with these attitudes. Our findings show that a non-trivial subset of participants appears to embrace the use of violence against police, and that these attitudes toward violence are associated with perceptions of the extent to which police treat protesters in a procedurally unjust manner.},

abstract = {Highly publicized incidents of police misconduct have adverse effects not only on the victims of abuse but also on public perceptions of the police departments implicated in the incident. Yet the magnitude and longevity of such effects have rarely been investigated. This article examines the impact of several celebrated incidents of perceived police misconduct in Los Angeles and New York City over a fairly lengthy time span, including the most recent scandal involving the Rampart Division of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and the killings of Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond in New York City. The analysis tracks public attitudes toward the police before and after each incident, and examines similarities and differences in the opinions of Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics. The often dramatic increase in unfavorable attitudes toward the police in the wake of highly publicized events suggests that such incidents have a pronounced effect on public opinion. Policy implications are discussed, drawing on citizens' attitudes toward measures that might prevent or reduce the frequency of future incidents of misconduct. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {[The purpose of this preliminary study is to evaluate and synthesize the most important theories of violence and then, on the basis of theories and additional data, to develop an eclectic and quantitative model of violence etiology. The author begins with a definition of violence followed by a list of 12 of its "causes." The 26 generalizations based on various published studies are given along with a summary of typologies of violence. The longest section of the study summarizes and evaluates 24 theories of violence, including the frustration-aggression hypothesis, the logical causal model, the circulation of the elites, the J-curve of satisfactions, the social change theory, and the Spiegel-Kluckhohn model. Finally, the author presents his own eclectic model of violence stressing human needs and their gratification, as well as six intervening variables that may influence violent behavior. Thus far, two variables of the model's components have been operationalized, the result being a "Family Violence Scale" and a "Violence Scale." When the rest of the variables have been similarly quantified, it is hoped that some etiological relationships among the various variables will be established.]},

Despite the theoretical and practical importance of police use of force, little is known about the sources of public attitudes toward it.

In this paper we test this possibility with data from the 1990 General Social Survey and find that negative stereotypes of African Americans contribute to whites' support for police use of excessive force.

abstract = {Over the last few decades there has been growing interest in youth participation, at policy level and in research. Generally, this is attributed to growing public concern regarding the ‘youth participatory deficit' and youth dissatisfaction in European societies. In contemporary discourse young people are positioned as a problem associated with a lack of participation in economic, social and political processes, which in turn is seen as a threat to the very foundation of democracy. Taking into consideration the neoliberal transformation of Western European cities towards increasing socioeconomic and ethno-cultural segregation, the authors argue that there is a pressing need to analyse youth participation as it is shaped by structural order and unequal access to resources, which creates spatial, material and symbolic divisions between different categories of young people. By placing it within a framework of citizenship theory, the authors analyse the enigmatic concept of ‘youth participation' through the prism of social exclusion, arguing for an understanding of participation as embedded in the social landscape of unequal power relations and life opportunities which are essential characteristics of the neo-liberal city.},

@phdthesis{Castillo2011,
abstract = {This research is an empirical study of the legitimacy of economic inequality with a focus on the case of Chile. Chile is an appealing case study in this regard because it has been one of the countries with the highest indexes of economic inequality over the past several decades. Theoretical perspectives based on the rational interest of the median voter have pointed out a negative association between high levels of inequality and legitimacy. Nevertheless, empirical evidence indicates that an unequal distribution of income is not necessarily challenged by the majority of a society, a phenomenon associated with the concept of legitimacy of economic inequality. Most empirical studies of this topic to date have considered social contexts that are not characterized by (comparatively) high levels of income inequality; thus, the impact of the level of inequality on its legitimacy remains largely unclear. The present study aimed at bridging this research gap, guided by the question: How do high levels of income inequality in a society influence the legitimacy of economic inequality? Using data obtained by comparative public opinion projects including the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and the International Social Justice Project (ISJP), this research considered individual preferences for occupational earnings inequality (the just earnings gap) as the main object of study. The central hypothesis was that individual preferences are strongly influenced by contextual standards such as the current income distribution, leading individuals of countries with high levels of inequality to have stronger average preferences for economic inequality (the so-called existential argument). Empirical evidence of legitimacy was related to two central dimensions based on David Beetham's multidimensional concept of legitimacy: (a) consensus regarding the inequality in the distribution of earnings in Chile and (b) the impact of the country level of income inequality on individual preferences for a larger just earnings gap. The empirical analysis provided partial evidence regarding the consensus about inequality in Chile, whereas in an international comparative framework, countries with higher levels of income inequality showed a stronger preference for a larger just earnings gap},

The result was a logarithmic function predicting precisely & unambiguously the magnitude of injustice associated with departures from perfect justice in the distribution of earned income. This formula is proposed as a universal law of justice evaluation in distributional matters. It is suggested that this law performs one of the three tasks essential to a scientific theory of distributive justice: to specify the kind & degree of injustice associated with given departures from justice. The other two tasks are to: (1) specify determination of the "just" term, & (2) specify behavioral consequences of the justice evaluation. 2 Tables. Modified HA},

abstract = {This article presents a theorem connecting the goodness or badness of a thing with the goodness or badness of inequality in the thing's distribution. The theorem, which applies to cardinally measurable things like income, debt, years in prison, disease risk, and risk of unemployment, states that if an observer regards the original thing as a good (bad), then that observer regards inequality in the thing's distribution as a bad (good). The proof uses three inequality measures and two fairness measures embedding observer framing of things as good or bad. The theorem touches many themes in the sociological literature, not only goods and bads, inequality and stratification, the Weberian life chances, values, and attitudes toward inequality, but also, via its proof, fairness and moral development. Further, the theorem and its proof raise questions that provide new directions for theoretical and empirical research. For example, empirical tasks ahead include (1) learning more about inequality in bads (especially about their frequency distributions and inequality measures, to match the growing knowledge about differences across subgroups), and (2) studying both just rewards and justice evaluations, in both goods and bads, to assess the scope of justice concerns between earned and unearned things and between additive, transferable possessions and nonadditive, nontransferable characteristics. Finally, this work contributes to the growing understanding of the connections between inequality, justice, and the vast behavioural and social outcomes which inequality and justice, separately or together, generate.},

abstract = {This article discusses the horizons of social justice research. Provoked by the desire to offer a similarly broad and inspirational commentary on the book, this issue of Social Justice Research features a novel approach to the book review essay, showcasing three independent essay contributions authored by leading scholars in the field of justice. In Essay 1, Kees van den Bos draws on Vermunt's book and recent research in social-cognitive psychology to promote the hypothesis that an individual's genuine concern for fairness tends to correct for the self-interested impulses that drive injustice. In Essay 2, inspired by the breadth of Vermunt's review, Russell Cropanzano and Jessica Kirk discuss the potential integration of social and natural science approaches to justice research, highlighting points of complementarity and contention, while also offering a path for further integration and strengthening of our understanding of justice. In Essay 3, Guillermina Jasso considers the observer perspective adopted in Vermunt's discussion, arguing that adoption of an even broader view of justice theory may yield a richer set of predictions about inequality. These three exemplary essay contributions continue Vermunt's dialogue, offering their own unique and insightful inputs on how individuals understand and shape the just nature of their world.

abstract = {This paper proposes a new model of wage determination and wage inequality. In this model, wage-setters set workers' wages; they do so either directly, as when individuals vote in a salary committee, or indirectly, as when political parties, via the myriad of social, economic, fiscal, and other policies, generate wages. The recommendations made by wage-setters (or arising from their policies) form a distribution, and all the wage-setter-specific distributions are combined into a single final wage distribution. There may be any number of wage-setters; some wage-setters count more than others; and the wage-setters may differ among themselves on both the wage distribution and the amounts recommended for particular workers. We use probability theory to derive initial results, including both distribution-independent and distribution-specific results. Fortuitously, elements of the model correspond to basic democratic principles. Thus, the model yields implications for the effects of democracy on wage inequality. These include: (1) the effects of the number of wage-setters and their power depend on the configuration of agreements and disagreements; (2) independence of mind reduces wage inequality, and dissent does so even more; (3) when leaders of democratic nations seek to forge an economic consensus, they are unwittingly inducing greater economic inequality; (4) arguments for independent thinking will be more vigorous in small societies than in large societies; (5) given a fixed distributional form for wages and two political parties which either ignore or oppose each other's distributional ideas, the closer the party split to 50ĝ€"50, the lower the wage inequality; and (6) under certain conditions the wage distribution within wage-setting context will be normal, but the normality will be obscured, as cross-context mixtures will display a wide variety of shapes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Sage Publications.},

The first section develops a framework for justice analysis, distinguishing between ingredients thought to be universal and ingredients in which culture may operate. The second section discusses deductive theories injustice analysis and provides an illustration, in which one of the theories yields implications for individualism and collectivism, thus showing how justice processes can generate phenomena that come to be viewed as culturally based.

The five levers highlight transfers, equal additions, negative assortative mating, wage schedules that reward multiple personal characteristics, and compensation procedures with voting rules, many voters, diversity of thought, and secret ballots.

abstract = {One of the most powerful predictors of violent political conflict is proximate violence in space and time. This spatiotemporal pattern has been identified between countries as well as within them. What explains this clustering is less clear, and different studies point to different mechanisms. Focusing on sub-Saharan African states, we examine whether population attitudes may contribute to the spread of political violence at subnational scales. In a quasi-experimental research design - using georeferenced survey data of 18,508 respondents for 162 administrative units across 16 countries, paired with precisely georeferenced conflict event data - we find that popular acceptance of (the legitimacy of) the use of physical violence is positively associated with subsequent conflict events. Furthermore, the combined effect of nearby violence and approval of violence is stronger than either condition alone, implying a diffusion effect. While we find some evidence that conflict events affect later public opinion, our final models control for violence that occurred before the survey data were gathered. The fact that we include such violence in our analysis suggests that the reported results cannot be dismissed as merely reflecting a reverse causal relationship.},

abstract = {Why do people support the harsh punishment of criminal offenders? This dissertation starts from the premise that views about punishment go far beyond concerns about crime and security. Punishment is a central component of the social order and a means by which social order is produced. It follows that ideological preferences will be crucial in understanding people's punitive reactions. People who have a preference for collective security might support punishment to restore order and cohesion. Yet, by committing crime, offenders also seem to gain power in society and punishment can restore the status quo. Punishment might therefore have positive value for people motivated to achieve social order (people high in right-wing authoritarianism, RWA) as well as for people motivated to achieve power and dominance (people high in social dominance orientation, SDO). In this dissertation I build on criminological and socialpsychological research to propose a dual-motivational model of punitive attitudes. I examine whether the effects of RWA and SDO are mediated by different beliefs about crime and symbolic motives of punishment (Paper 1) and whether they predict different retributive goals of punishment (Paper 2). Finally, I explore the circumstances under which RWA and SDO predict punitive attitudes (Papers 3 and 4). The four papers presented in this dissertation suggest that there are, indeed, two ideological antecedents to punitive attitudes. High RWA individuals favoured harsh punishment to restore collective security, maintain hierarchies and avoid powerful criminals disrupting social order. High SDO's did so to establish and maintain power and status hierarchies in society. However, the effect of SDO was limited to situations where crime was associated with a competitive situation. Punitiveness seems to be related to a groupbased competition for status and power with criminal offenders. Yet, high SDO individuals are not predisposed to think of criminal offenders as threats to hierarchies.},

abstract = {Three explanations dominate the literature as to why people support tough sentencing of criminal offenders. The first is an instrumental perspective: people are concerned about becoming a victim of crime and they look to punishment to reduce future harm. The second is a relational perspective: people are concerned about community breakdown, and they support punishment to restore moral boundaries. The third is a psychological model based on ideological preferences: people desire conformity and authority in society, and they look to institutions to punish transgressions that threaten collective security. Building on the work of Tyler and Boeckmann (1977), we show that right-wing authoritarianism predicts both the extent to which people worry about social threats and the extent to which they support harsh punitive measures.

@book{Merleau-Ponty1969,
abstract = {Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Humanism and Terror, Beacon Press, Boston, 1999 We must remember that liberty becomes a false engign - a 'solemn complement' of violence - as soon as it becomes only an idea and we begin to defend liberty instead of free men. (preface xxiv) In contrast, true liberty takes others as they are, tries to understand even those doctrines which are its negation, and never allows itself to judge before understanding. (preface xxiv-xxv) We suggest that every man who undertakes to play a role carries around him, as Diderot said of the actor on the stage, a 'great fantom' in which he is forever hidden, and he is responsible for his role even when he cannot find in it what he wanted to be. (preface xxxii) We argue that an action can produce something else than envisaged, but nevertheless political man assumes its consequences. (preface xxxvi) Forced to choose between action and respect for respect for consciences which are mutually exclusive and yet solicit one another, if the respect is to be meaningful and the action humane, is not our choice always good and always bad? (preface xxxviii) Hegel had admirably expressed the impartiality of the hero who can see well that his adversaries are not necessarily 'wretches', everyone being right in a sense, and accomplishes his task without hoping for everyone's approval, nor his own entirely. (preface xxxix) In the last analysis, the truth from which they are running is that man has no rights over the world, that he is not, to talk like Sartre, 'man by divine right', that he is thrown into an adventure whose happy end is not guaranteed any more than the harmony of mind and will assured in principle. (preface xlii) Terror Once humanism attempts to fulfill itself with any consistency it becomes transformed into its opposite, namely, into violence. (p. 13) The Trials remain on a subjective level and never approach what is called 'true' justice, objective and timeless, because they bear upon facts still open toward the future, which consequently are not yet univocal and only acquire a definitively criminal character when they are viewed from the perspective on the future held by the men in power. (p.27) In the end everyone agrees that political acts are to be judged not only according to their meaning for the moral agent but also according to the sense they acquire in the historical context and dialectical phase in which such acts originate. (p.33) ({\ldots}) in history there is no absolute neutrality or objectivity, that the apparent innocent judgment which states a probability in reality sketches what is possible, and that every existential judgment is a value judgment; even laisser faire involves a commitment. (p.39) [like with De Varela, strong emphasis on identity as an implicit background, formed through action] They are defined less by their ideas than by the position they occupy in the movement of history. A movement's responsibility is determined by the role it plays in a network of events, just as a man's character resides much more in his basic enterprise than in his explicit choices. (p.58) If the role of the intellectual and his outlook is to discover in a given assembly of facts several possible meanings to be evaluated methodically, whereas the politician is the one who with perhaps the fewest ideas perceives most surely the real significance and pattern in a given situation, Bukharin's instability could then be explained in terms of the intellectual's psychology. (p.63) [on personal responsibility] Whatever his goodwill, man undertakes to act without being able to appreciate exactly the objective sense of his action; he constructs his own image of the future which has onlo a probable basis and in reality solicits that future so that he can be condemned for it because the event in itself is not unequivocal. A dialectic whose course is not entirely foreseeable can transform a man's intentions into their opposite and yet one has to take sides from the very start. (p.64) Thus history is not comparable to a machine, but to a living being. There is a science of the revolution, but there is also a revolutionary praxis which that science clarifies but does not replace. There is a spontaneous movement of objective history, but there is also a human intervention which makes it leap stages and which cannot be foretold from theoretical schemas. (p.89) [hunches that point to ct] But the point is that we are not spectators of a closed history; we are actors in an open history, our praxis introduces the element of construction rather than knowledge as an ingredient of the world, making the world not simply an object of contemplation but something to be transformed. What we cannot imagine is a consciousness without a future and a history without an end. Thus, as long as there are men, the future will be open and there will be only a probabilistic calculation and no absolute knowledge. (p.92) [the battle for interpretation and meaning] 'Each self-consciousness aims at the destruction and death of the other,' says Hegel. Inasmuch as self-consciousness gives meaning and value to every object that we can grasp, it is by nature in a state of vertigo and it is a ermanent temptation for it to assert itself as the expense of other consciousnesses who dispute its privilege. (p.102) [microworlds] Between men considered as pure consciousness there would indeed be no reason to choose. But between men considered as the incumbents of situations which together compose a single common situation it is inevitable that one has to choose - it is allowable to sacrifice those who according to the logic of their situation are a threat and to promote those who offer a promise of humanity.(p.110) [MP talking in ct terms]},

abstract = {Much of the literature on torture in recent years takes the position of denouncing the barbarity of torture, while allowing for exceptions to this veto in extreme circumstances. The ticking-bomb argument, where a terrorist is tortured in order to extract information of a primed bomb located in a civilian area, is often invoked as one of those extreme circumstances where torture becomes justified. As the War on Terrorism intensifies, the ticking-bomb argu- ment has become the dominant line of reasoning used by both academics and policy advisers to justify a legalized, state-sponsored program of torture. This paper argues for the unconditional refutation of any attempt to justify torture, without exceptions. We argue against the consequentialist reasoning of the ticking-bomb argument not from a deontological position, but on consequentialist grounds. Empirical evidence suggests that the institutionalization of torture practices creates serious problems. Torture interrogation fails to fulfil its initial purpose as a low-cost life saver, while its long-term potential is the devastation of democratic institutions.},

abstract = {Meritocratic attitudes are defined as general beliefs that education and its correlates should determine personal economic outcomes. Using the International Social Survey Project (ISSP): Social Inequality Module (1992), we examine both individual-level and country-level determinants of pro-meritocratic attitudes. According to self-interest and rational-action theories, individuals with high educational attainment and high personal income are expected to have strong meritocratic beliefs because meritocracy is in their best interestthey would gain under such a system. At the same time, both modernization and post-industrial theories imply that persons living in countries with a high degree of societal meritocracy hold stronger meritocratic beliefs than persons living in countries with low degree of societal meritocracy. Results of the Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analysis on a data set including 7,972 persons from 14 countries indicate that the impact of individuals' education and income on meritocratic attitudes occurred as theoretically predicted. We also demonstrate that the relationship between the degree of societal meritocracy and the degree of support for such a system is statistically significant even if national wealth and educational stock (as well as individual-level variables) are controlled. In addition, we discovered that at the beginning of the 1990s a post-communist regime had a negative effect on support for meritocracy. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

abstract = {Societal inequality has been found to harm the mental and physical health of its members and undermine overall social cohesion. Here, we tested the hypothesis that economic inequality is associated with a wish for a strong leader in a study involving 28 countries from five continents (Study 1, N = 6,112), a study involving an Australian community sample (Study 2, N = 515), and two experiments (Study 3a, N = 96; Study 3b, N = 296). We found correlational (Studies 1 and 2) and experimental (Studies 3a and 3b) evidence for our prediction that higher inequality enhances the wish for a strong leader. We also found that this relationship is mediated by perceptions of anomie, except in the case of objective inequality in Study 1. This suggests that societal inequality enhances the perception that society is breaking down (anomie) and that a strong leader is needed to restore order (even when that leader is willing to challenge democratic values).},

abstract = {Does economic inequality breed political violence? For almost half a century, scholars have tried to test this assumption, finding little empirical support for a statistical relationship between the two variables. This article provides a critical review of this literature, starting out with the link between so-called vertical (inter-individual) inequality and conflict. I argue that the lack of empirical results can largely be attributed to the almost exclusive focus on individual-level differences in terms of income or land. Group identity is critical to recruitment and maintaining allegiance to a military organization. Hence, we should focus the attention on the relevant form of inequality- that between groups, or so-called horizontal inequalities. In contrast to the studies focusing on vertical inequality, an emerging quantitative literature on horizontal inequalities and conflict has found a positive link, which is more in line with the evidence from several case studies. However, measuring horizontal inequalities is a clear challenge, and there is a need for additional studies to qualify the initial findings. I conclude by suggesting some avenues for future research. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Whether and how societal structures shape individual psychology is a foundational question of the social sciences. Combining insights from evolutionary biology, economy, and the political and psychological sciences, we identify a central psychological process that functions to sustain group-based hierarchies in human societies. In study 1, we demonstrate that macrolevel structural inequality, impaired population outcomes, socio-political instability, and the risk of violence are reflected in the endorsement of group hegemony at the aggregate population level across 27 countries (n = 41,824): The greater the national inequality, the greater is the endorsement of between-group hierarchy within the population. Using multilevel analyses in study 2, we demonstrate that these psychological group-dominance motives mediate the effects of macrolevel functioning on individual-level attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, across 30 US states (n = 4,613), macrolevel inequality and violence were associated with greater individuallevel support of group hegemony. Crucially, this individual-level support, rather than cultural-societal norms, was in turn uniquely associated with greater racism, sexism, welfare opposition, and even willingness to enforce group hegemony violently by participating in ethnic persecution of subordinate out-groups. These findings suggest that societal inequality is reflected in people's minds as dominance motives that underpin ideologies and actions that ultimately sustain group-based hierarchy.},

abstract = {Sociological research on political protest and violence either attempts to explain violence by absolute or relative deprivation or by rational action, resource mobilisation and political power (or by some combination of these factors). Although the connection between these theoretical approaches and crossnational studies rests on little more than considerations of plausibility, monotonic linkages between the level of economic development or income inequality and violence seem to fit with deprivation approaches, whereas a curvilinear relationship between regime repressiveness and violence fits easily with a rational action or political power explanations. Taking the disagreement between previous cross-national studies as a starting point, but analysing a new compilation of data, which covers up to 47 nations and the mid-1960s, the following conclusions are reached. First, inequality does not contribute to violence. Second, the level of economic development does not affect violence. Third, there is a rather weak curvilinear relationship between regime repressiveness and violence. Thus while deprivation explanations of violence receive no support at all in this study, there is at least some weak support for rational action or political power explanations. {\textcopyright} 1987 Oxford University Press.},

@article{Wilkinson2004,
abstract = {The most well-established environmental determinant of levels of violence is the scale of income differences between rich and poor. More unequal societies tend to be more violent. If this is a relation between institutional violence and personal violence, how does it work and why is most of the violence a matter of the poor attacking the poor rather than the rich? This paper begins by showing that the tendency for rates of violent crime and homicide to be higher where there is more inequality is part of a more general tendency for the quality of social relations to be poorer in more hierarchical societies. Research on the social determinants of health is used to explore these relationships. It is a powerful source of insights because health is also harmed by greater inequality. Because epidemiological research has gone some way towards identifying the nature of our sensitivity to the social environment and to social status differentials in particular, it provides important insights into why violence is related to inequality. The picture that emerges substantiates and explains the common intuition that inequality is socially corrosive. With an evolutionary slant, and informed by work on ranking systems in non-human primates, this paper focuses on the sharp distinction between competitive social strategies appropriate to dominance hierarchies and the more affiliative social strategies associated with more egalitarian social structures. The implications for policy seem to echo the importance to the quality of life of the three inter-related dimensions of the social environment expressed in the demand for "liberty, equality, fraternity." {\textcopyright} 2004 New York Academy of Sciences.},

The contributors provide thoughtful reflections on the struggles and opportunities instructors face in teaching about these topics while competing against the invisibility of capitalist forces and prevalent social myths, such as "anyone who works hard can achieve". This book will not only help instructors empower students to recognize economic injustice and its interaction with capitalist organization, but also develops and acts on transformative solutions. Through analysis of the classed dimensions of the current political, economics, and cultural climate, as well as presenting novel lesson plans and classroom activities, this book is of great value for college and university professors.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which police legitimacy and social identity explain variation in public acceptance of police use of force. The authors assess whether there is an association between legitimacy and public acceptance of apparently illegal or unethical police action; and the extent to which identification with a particular social group predicts judgments of police behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The study draws upon cross-sectional data from a 2015 survey of a representative sample of adults in England and Wales. Structural equation modeling is used to model conditional correlations between latent constructs. Findings: There are two main findings. First, identifying more strongly with a social group that the police may be seen to represent was consistently associated with greater acceptance of police use of force, whether or not that force seemed to be justified. Second, beliefs about the legitimacy of the police were also associated with acceptance, but primarily only in relation to the use of force in situations where it appeared prima facie justifiable. Social implications: Results suggest one possible set of reasons why police retain public support in the face of scandals concerning excessive use of force. Originality/value: This is one of only very few studies that have used survey data to explore lay justifications for police use of force.},

In the study, which used a modification of Interaction Process Analysis, 96 White paid undergraduates, observing a videotape of purported ongoing interaction occurring in another room, labeled an act (ambiguous shove) as more violent when it was performed by a Black than when the same act was perpetrated by a White, indicating that the concept of violence was more accessible when viewing a Black, as compared to a White, committing the same act. Causal attributions were also divergent. Situation attributions were preferred when the harm-doer was White, and person (dispositional) attributions were preferred in the Black-protagonist conditions.

abstract = {Exposure to violence in the family-of-origin has consistently been linked to intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration in adulthood. However, whether the transmission of violence across generations is role- and gender-specific still remains unclear. The current study examined the effects of experiencing child abuse and observing parental violence on IPV perpetration among a sample of male arrestees (N = 303). The differential effects of observing violence perpetrated by same-sex (father to mother), opposite-sex (mother to father), and both parents on subsequent IPV perpetration were examined. Logistic regression analyses showed that while observing father-only violence and bidirectional interparental violence was predictive of IPV perpetration, observing mother-only violence and direct experiences of child abuse was not. These findings suggest that the transmission of violence across generations is both role- and gender-specific and highlight the importance of examining unique dimensions of partner violence to assess influences on children. The study further examined whether attitudes justifying wife beating mediate the effect of exposure to violence and subsequent IPV perpetration. Results showed that although attitudes were predictive of perpetration, these attitudes did not mediate the relationship.},

abstract = {Across five experiments, we show that dehumanization—the act of perceiving victims as not completely human—increases instrumental, but not moral, violence. In attitude surveys, ascribing reduced capacities for cognitive, experiential, and emotional states to victims predicted support for practices where victims are harmed to achieve instrumental goals, including sweatshop labor, animal experimentation, and drone strikes that result in civilian casualties, but not practices where harm is perceived as morally righteous, including capital punishment, killing in war, and drone strikes that kill terrorists. In vignette experiments, using dehumanizing compared with humanizing language increased participants' willingness to harm strangers for money, but not participants' willingness to harm strangers for their immoral behavior. Participants also spontaneously dehumanized strangers when they imagined harming them for money, but not when they imagined harming them for their immoral behavior. Finally, participants humanized strangers who were low in humanity if they imagined harming them for immoral behavior, but not money, suggesting that morally motivated perpetrators may humanize victims to justify violence against them. Our findings indicate that dehumanization enables violence that perpetrators see as unethical, but instrumentally beneficial. In contrast, dehumanization does not contribute to moral violence because morally motivated perpetrators wish to harm complete human beings who are capable of deserving blame, experiencing suffering, and understanding its meaning.},

abstract = {Attitudes toward men's violence against women shape both the perpetration of violence against women and responses to this violence by the victim and others around her. For these reasons, attitudes are the target of violence-prevention campaigns. To improve understanding of the determinants of violence against women and to aid the development of violence-prevention efforts, this article reviews the factors that shape attitudes toward violence against women. It offers a framework with which to comprehend the complex array of influences on attitudes toward violent behavior perpetrated by men against women. Two clusters of factors, associated with gender and culture, have an influence at multiple levels of the social order on attitudes regarding violence. Further factors operate at individual, organizational, communal, or societal levels in particular, although their influence may overlap across multiple levels. This article concludes with recommendations regarding efforts to improve attitudes toward violence against women. {\textcopyright} 2009 SAGE Publications.},

Attitudes have been examined in relation to men's perpetration of violence, women's experience of violence and community and institutional responses. In this article we argue that there has not been sufficient interrogation of the limitations of attitudes in understanding and addressing men's violence. We propose a social constructionist approach to attitudes and emphasise the need to locate attitudes within the context of familial, organisational, community and social norms which support violence against women. Furthermore, we argue that to prevent violence against women, we must develop interventions beyond cultural and attitudinal change to encompass changes in structural relations and social practices.},

The findings indicate that age, gender, and SES are related to attitudes toward retribution and courage and to disputatiousness. Further, attitudes toward courage and retribution have significant effects on disputatiousness and violence, which explains a substantial portion of SES effects. The results suggest that lower-class persons are more likely to engage in violence to a large extent because they are more punitive and place greater emphasis on showing courage in conflicts.},

A three-wave between-subjects analysis revealed that attitudes towards war became more positive after September 11, 2001 and remained high over a year afterwards. Self-reported trait physical aggression also rose after September 11. Attitudes towards penal code violence (PCV) became more positive immediately after September 11, but were somewhat reduced a year afterward. A two-wave within subjects study revealed that war attitudes became even more positive at 2 months post-September 11. Attitudes towards PCV became less positive during this time period, but only for women. Other aggression-related attitudes were not affected in either study. These studies demonstrate that a large-scale event can change attitudes, but those attitudes must be directly relevant to the event. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Why do “ordinary” people engage in collective violence, harming others on behalf of their group? In this article, we argue that the violent group itself, and the identity it bestows on participating members, is an often overlooked and yet fundamental source of motivation for an individual's participation in collective violence. Reviewing insights from social and moral psychology, military history, and public health, we outline how the psychology of individual violent behavior presents a puzzle. For an ordinary person, participation in violence is often an aversive and distressing experience, and yet violent behavior leads to more violence in the future. A better understanding of the dynamics of collective violence allows us to make sense of this paradox. Violent groups can promote violent behavior among members by increasing members' motivation to engage in violence, particularly through group identification and deliberate strategies, and by removing psychological obstacles to violence (i.e., by making violence less aversive). Our synthesis ofthe literature points to a cycle ofindividuals' participation in collective violence, in which group identification motivates violent behavior and violent behavior increases identification with violent groups.},

@book{Mansley2013,
abstract = {In this book David Mansley argues that the frequency with which violence intrudes on to the streets is related to both how society is governed and how it is policed. With the help of an innovative methodology, he quantifies and tests three variables - collective violence, democracy and protest policing - using protests in Great Britain in 1999-2011, for his sampling frame. The result is the design of new tools of measurement and a harvest of new data, including previously unpublished details of banning orders and riot damages, that enable us to reflect, with the benefit of broad sociological perspective, on the causes of contemporary violent events. Mansley's explanation of the trends he identifies draws from the work of the best thinkers on violence - especially Charles Tilly, Thomas Hobbes and Norbert Elias. He shows how the style of protest policing and the depth of democracy, both of which function under the direction of the political economy, are crucial to the state's credentials as the monopoly supplier of legitimate violence. His discussion touches on such current topics as the institution of police commissioners, the privatisation of policing duties, and the decline in homicide. This cultured study, which includes an engaging review of the existing scholarship on violence, is essential material for undergraduate and postgraduate students reading criminology, sociology or political theory. {\textcopyright} 2014 David R.

M{{\'{e}}}todo: Ensaio cl{{\'{i}}}nico randomizado realizado na UTI Neonatal do Hospital das Cl{{\'{i}}}nicas de Botucatu–UNESP, comparando duas t{{\'{e}}}cnicas fisioterap{{\^{e}}}uticas, aplicadas em rec{{\'{e}}}m-nascidos prematuros, nas primeiras 48 horas p{{\'{o}}}s-extuba{{\c{c}}}{{\~{a}}}o.

In this study we examined attitudes regarding violence against women in samples of undergraduate women and men students from four countries: India, Japan, Kuwait, and the United States. Attitudes toward sexual assault and spousal physical violence differed between men and women and across the four countries. Variations in gender differences across countries indicated that, for attitudes regarding sexual assault of women in particular, sociocultural factors may be a stronger influence than gender. Findings suggest the importance of examining differences within the larger sociocultural context of political, historical, religious, and economic influences on attitudes toward gender roles and violence against women.},

Sociological methodologists have argued that fixed-effects (FE) models are generally the best starting point for analyzing panel data because they allow analysts to control for unobserved time-constant heterogeneity. We review these treatments and demonstrate the advantages of FE models in the context of the GSS. We also show, however, that FE models have two rarely tested assumptions that can seriously bias parameter estimates when violated. We provide simple tests for these assumptions. We further demonstrate that FE models are extremely sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags. We provide a simulation and a proof to show that the use of incorrect lags in FE models can lead to coefficients that are the opposite sign of the true parameter values.},

abstract = {Longitudinal data analysis for biomedical and behavioral sciences. This innovative book sets forth and describes methods for the analysis of longitudinaldata, emphasizing applications to problems in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Reflecting the growing importance and use of longitudinal data across many areas of research, the text is designed to help users of statistics better analyze and understand this type of data. Much of the material from the book grew out of a course taught by Dr. Hedeker on longitudinal data analysis. The material is, therefore, thoroughly classroom tested and includes a number of features designed to help readers better understand and apply the material. Statistical procedures featured within the text include: Repeated measures analysis of variance; Multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures; Random-effects regression models (RRM); Covariance-pattern models; Generalized-estimating equations (GEE) models; Generalizations of RRM and GEE for categorical outcomes. Practical in their approach, the authors emphasize the applications of the methods, using real-world examples for illustration. Some syntax examples are provided, although the authors do not generally focus on software in this book. Several datasets and computer syntax examples are posted on this title's companion Web site. The authors intend to keep the syntax examples current as new versions of the software programs emerge. This text is designed for both undergraduate and graduate courses in longitudinal data analysis. Instructors can take advantage of overheads and additional course materials available online for adopters. Applied statisticians in biomedicine and the social sciences can also use the book as a convenient reference.},

This review emphasizes regression methods that capitalize on the strengths of panel data for consistently estimating causal parameters in models for metric outcomes when measured explanatory variables are correlated with unit-specific unobservables.

abstract = {Many economic and social surveys are designed as panel studies, which provide important data for describing social changes and testing causal relations between social phenomena. This textbook shows how to manage, describe, and model these kinds of data. It presents models for continuous and categorical dependent variables, focusing either on the level of these variables at different points in time or on their change over time. It covers fixed and random effects models, models for change scores and event history models. All statistical methods are explained in an application-centered style using research examples from scholarly journals, which can be replicated by the reader through data provided on the accompanying website. As all models are compared to each other, it provides valuable assistance with choosing the right model in applied research. The textbook is directed at master and doctoral students as well as applied researchers in the social sciences, psychology, business administration and economics. Readers should be familiar with linear regression and have a good understanding of ordinary least squares estimation.},

abstract = {Many countries that have recently undergone transitions to democracy have experienced increases in violent crime. Yet sociological theories have generally failed to consider the impact of political factors on crime. The author examines the relation between greater electoral competition and homicide at the subnational level in a country undergoing an uneven transition to democracy. In societies characterized by the presence of patronage networks, social and political changes that undermine the source of unequal exchange between actors at different levels in the social hierarchy result in a temporary loss of social control and an increase in crime. The relation between electoral competition and homicide is tested using electoral results from a sample of 1,800 Mexican municipalities. Greater electoral competition is associated with higher homicide rates across municipalities and over time, even after controlling for standard correlates of violent crime. Consistent with the hypothesis that the increase is due to the disruption of patronage networks, this association is present only in rural areas where patron-client relations are more common.},

However, in some studies the potential pitfalls of these models may be ignored, and common critiques of FE models may not always be applicable in comparison to other methods. This article provides an overview of linear FE models and their pitfalls for applied researchers. Throughout the article, we contrast FE and classical pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) models. We argue that in most cases FE models are at least as good as pooled OLS models. Therefore, we encourage scholars to use FE models if possible. Nevertheless, the limitations of FE models should be known and considered.},

abstract = {Does X affect Y? Answering this question is particularly difficult if reverse causality is looming. Many social scientists turn to panel data to address such questions of causal ordering. Yet even in longitudinal analyses reverse causality threatens causal inference based on conventional panel models. Whereas the methodological literature has suggested various alternative solutions, these approaches face many criticisms, chief among them to be sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags. Applied researchers are thus left with little guidance. Seeking to provide such guidance, we compare how different panel models perform under a range of different conditions. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that unlike conventional panel models, a cross-lagged panel model with fixed effects not only offers protection against bias arising from reverse causality under a wide range of conditions but also helps to circumvent the problem of misspecified temporal lags. the reviewers for helpful comments.

The significance of politics, conflict and critique to Boltanski's sociology are highlighted. Bolanski explains why he regards May 1968 as a major disruption of the capitalist social order and how the conservative response to this contestation subsequently prevailed in France. The reorganisation of capitalism in recent decades has increased social division, yet Boltanski believes that the recent recession and existing discontent could lead to unexpected outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2014, SAGE Publications.

And (3) they live within social structures and systems that perpetuate these "culture-of-honor" meanings and ideologies. Laboratory experiments, field experiments, surveys, analyses of laws, and records of homicide rates are reviewed. Also, we discuss the legacy of slavery, which legitimized forms of coercive and punitive violence over and above violence legitimized by a culture of honor. Southern violence cannot be understood simply as deviance and lawlessness. Rather, it is a product of a coherent meaning system defining the self, honor, rituals for conflict, and tools that may be used when order is disrupted.},

Hirschman famously argued that citizens of democracies have only three possible responses to injustice or wrongdoing by their government: we may leave, complain, or comply. But in When All Else Fails, Jason Brennan argues that there is fourth option. When governments violate our rights, we may resist. We may even have a moral duty to do so. For centuries, almost everyone has believed that we must allow the government and its representatives to act without interference, no matter how they behave. We may complain, protest, sue, or vote officials out, but we can't fight back. But Brennan makes the case that we have no duty to allow the state or its agents to commit injustice. We have every right to react with acts of "uncivil disobedience." We may resist arrest for violation of unjust laws. We may disobey orders, sabotage government property, or reveal classified information. We may deceive ignorant, irrational, or malicious voters. We may even use force in self-defense or to defend others. The result is a provocative challenge to long-held beliefs about how citizens may respond when government officials behave unjustly or abuse their power.

abstract = {Violence depends not only on long-standing background conditions but on time-patterns that determine when and if it breaks out, how long it lasts and how severe it is. Advances in recording technology including video cameras and CCTV have made it possible to locate turning points and sequences on the micro level. Different scales of violence have different time-dynamics, ranging from micro to meso to macro. These include the following: micro-rhythms (fractions of seconds) of synchronization and dominance in setting rhythms in face-to-face interaction; violence-triggering thresholds (a few minutes or less) in small groups, where boredom makes violence abort; tension-building danger time-zones (lasting a few hours) in organized crowds; revolutionary tipping points (a few days); duration of riots (a few days, but several weeks long if the riot moves from place to place or is intermittently scheduled); mass crisis and hysteria zone of national solidarity, rapidly reaching a plateau and lasting 3 to 6 months before declining; and macro time-forks, where sudden victory is relatively low in casualties, but where a stalemate leads to years of dispersed conflict with high attrition costs. Keywords atrocities, duration of riots, forward panic, national solidarity, revolutionary tipping points, violence-triggering thresholds Why does violence happen at one particular time rather than another? Most of the time it does not happen. Antagonistic relationships are more widespread than physical violence. Threatened violence often aborts; when it does break out, how long it lasts and with what severity of damage varies considerably. These are the conclusions of Violence: A Micro-sociological Theory (Collins, 2008), synthesizing evidence from situational observations of people on the threshold of violence. The crucial turning points in conflict and violence are matters of process and temporary situational configurations. Research in recent years},

abstract = {This paper addresses the role of the research question in social research. It outlines what is taken to be the conventional view in many methodological discussions, namely, that research questions guide decisions about research design and research methods. This position is taken to imply that social researchers typically take the view that research methods need to be tailored to the research questions that guide an investigation. The paper questions how far this position pertains to actual research practice. Drawing on interviews with researchers about their practices in relation to mixed-method research, two discourses were found in the transcripts. A particularistic discourse that reflects the traditional view, whereby mixed-method research is viewed as only appropriate when research questions warrant it, was uncovered. In addition, a universalistic discourse, which sees mixed-method research as more generally superior, was also uncovered. The implications of these viewpoints for understanding the role of research questions are then discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Taylor & Francis.},

We review 52 articles in organization studies and develop a typology of how researchers construct their research questions from existing literature. The most common way across paradigmatic camps is to spot various 'gaps' in the literature and, based on that, to formulate specific research questions. The dominance of gap-spotting is surprising, given it is increasingly recognized that theory is made interesting and influential when it challenges assumptions that underlie existing literature. The article discusses why assumption-challenging approaches are rare, and it identifies a range of social norms that favour gap-spotting. Finally, the article proposes some ways of constructing research questions that move beyond gap-spotting, and discusses how these ways are likely to promote more interesting and significant theories. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

abstract = {Resumen Los modelos que tradicionalmente se han utilizado en el an{\'{a}}lisis de datos de medidas repetidas son de car{\'{a}}cter lineal y siguen el enfoque basado en el an{\'{a}}li-sis de la variancia. Su principal desventaja es que debe disponerse de datos balanceados lo que, en contextos aplicados, es dif{\'{i}}cil de conseguir. Por esto, se han desa-rrollado modelos alternativos como el estudio de curvas de crecimiento, del que se han derivado gran cantidad de m{\'{e}}todos. Todos estos m{\'{e}}todos, adem{\'{a}}s de modelar la variancia entre e intra individuos, no requieren datos balanceados. En la actualidad, se aplican los modelos lineales mixtos como una alternativa global de an{\'{a}}lisis. Los modelos mixtos estiman tanto los valores esperados de las observaciones (efectos fijos) como las variancias y covariancias de las observaciones (efectos aleatorios). Lo que distingue, por tanto, al modelo lineal mixto del modelo lineal general, es el c{\'{a}}lculo de los par{\'{a}}metros de covariancia que permiten analizar datos de car{\'{a}}cter lon-gitudinal (correlacionados, incompletos y con intervalos entre observaciones no constantes).

Abstract The models that traditionally have been used to analyse repeated measure data are linear and follow an approach based on analysis of variance. Their main drawback is that they require balanced data, something that is difficult to achieve in applied contexts. Therefore, alternative models such as the study of growth curves have been developed, which in turn have been used to derive a large number of met-hods. These methods model both between-and wit-hin-individual variation and do not require balanced data. Today, linear mixed models are applied as a general analytical alternative. Mixed models estimate both the expected values of observations (fixed effects) and the variances and covariances of the observations (random effects). So what distinguishes the linear mixed model from the general linear model is the cal-culation of covariance parameters which allow the analysis of longitudinal data (correlated, incomplete, and with non-constant intervals between observa-tions).},

@article{Gross2009,
abstract = {During asymmetric war, a state actor often faces charges of disproportionate harm while the weaker, nonstate side must defend itself against charges of terrorism. Because the state actor faces an adversary embedded among civilians, and the nonstate actor confronts an opponent whose military targets are often so well protected that only its nonmilitary targets are vulnerable, it is difficult for either side to fight without harming civilians. While humanitarian law tries to protect noncombatants to the greatest extent possible, too strict an interpretation of terrorism and proportionality may unduly restrict either side's ability to pursue political claims by force of arms. To successfully walk the line between protecting civilians during asymmetric war and allowing each side a 'fighting chance', it is necessary to take another look at the idea of intentionality and the definition of combatants. While intentional harm is the hallmark of terrorism, state armies also bring intentional harm if they expect to glean military benefits from causing collateral damage to civilians. A tighter understanding of intentionality can further protect innocent, noncombatant civilians. At the same time, however, the international community must recognise that not all civilians are noncombatants. Many civilians take a direct or indirect role in the fighting. As such, some civilians are vulnerable to lethal harm while others remain subject to nonlethal harm. Asymmetric war expands the range of permissible civilian targets that each side may attack without incurring charges of terrorism or disproportionate harm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

The findings indicate that experiencing violence while growing up is related to favorable attitudes towards violence against spouses. The experience of violence while growing up and attitudes are related to violence against both children and spouses. The relationship between experiencing violence while growing up and engaging in violence against spouses is mediated by attitudes. The results also suggest that men and nonwhites are more approving of violence towards spouses.

Method: The sample consisted of 656 young people between the ages of 18 and 30 years (79.5% women). Results: Regression analysis showed that justification of cyber dating abuse was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of direct aggression in online dating relationships. Myths about love were associated with a greater likelihood of control in online dating relationships. Furthermore, the relationship between justification of cyber dating abuse and perpetration of direct aggression was stronger in women. The relationship between myths about love and perpetration of online control was stronger among the youngest individuals. Conclusion: The justification of abuse and myths about love are important aspects in the development of different kinds of online abuse among young couples. This finding has important implications for the prevention of and intervention in these behaviors.},

Moreover, the violent event is structuring the order of the action sequences in an actual violent (embodied) interaction. The interactional dynamics in violent encounters between co-present actors shapes the specific forms of the experiencing in (and of) the violent interaction. Based on how violence is experienced in an interactive situation, the phenomenon of violence articulates itself according to three coordinates: directedness, co-performativity and de-capabilisation. The outlining of the structure of the lived experience of violence is revealing something irreducible in it. To understand the experience of violence as such, I propose that we accept the idea of violence per se and depart from the idea that the acts of violence are essentially moral actions. The core of the ethical-moral discussion concerning violence should be grounded instead on the moment of conversion identifiable when we take into account the reaction to violence.},

Although the methods used most often in violence research have led to a wealth of important findings, the field is ripe for both reflection and innovation. The purpose of this special issue is to highlight critical measurement issues in the study of violence and to describe innovative approaches that will move this research forward. In this Introduction to the special issue, we identify 3 challenges for the valid measurement of violence-defining constructs, accurately capturing responses in scoring, and diversifying measurement methods-and discuss how the 8 studies that constitute the issue address these challenges and identify promising directions for future work.},

abstract = {In this thesis the concept of structural violence has been elaborated along with its position vis-{\`{a}}-vis Foucault's theory of bio-power. Considered as an alternative to the mainstream accounts of violence, that only sees violence as a physical, visible, intentional, and intersubjective act of harm, a more comprehensive understanding of violence, involving the concept of structural violence, is championed throughout. The concept of structural violence is put forth as an alternative view for recognizing invisible though equally fatal instances of violent actions. It is then combined with Foucault's accounts of power, and especially his concept of bio-power. It has been maintained that two concepts overlap greatly, especially in Foucault's accounts of neoliberal power. In the last chapter, this argument is supported by examples taken from different case studies conducted by different authors that reflect the violent effects of neoliberal practices. Keywo},

abstract = {This review of the literature is a cross-disciplinary and systematic analysis of the concept of violence in human societies. The article provides a framework for understanding the phenomenon of violence in such areas as: sociology, political science, anthropology, and philosophy. Two main concept types of violence definitions were differentiated, described, and examined: the narrow and the broad. The narrow definition of violence is characteristic mainly in the political science field, where violence is defined as the unauthorized (illegal, unlawful) use of physical force. The broad definition of violence is associated with sociology, anthropology, and philosophy. The broad concepts are strongly varied in scope and content, including numerous phenomena, such as hate speech, structural and cultural violence, and other manifestations of latent violence, including: iconic violence, media and symbolic violence. Politically motivated violence is a special kind of violence. This is a paradoxical phenomenon - condemned and at the same time indispensable in contemporary political systems and democratic regimes. The review gives rise to different ideas and ways of defining the concept of violence. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The ability of international ethics and political theory to establish a genuinely critical standpoint from which to evaluate uses of armed force has been challenged by various lines of argument. On one, theorists question the narrow conception of violence on which analysis relies. Were they right, it would overturn two key assumptions: first, that violence is sufficiently distinctive to merit attention as a category separate from other modes of human harming; second, that it is troubling in a special way that makes acts of violence peculiarly hard to justify. This paper defends a narrow understanding of violence and a special ethics governing its use by arguing that a distinctive form of 'Violent Agency' is the factor uniting the category while partly accounting for the fearful connotations of the term. Violent Agency is defined first by a double intention (1) to inflict harm using a technique chosen (2) to eliminate or evade the target's means of escaping it or defending against it. Second, the harms it aims at are destructive (as opposed to appropriative). The analysis offered connects the concept of violence to themes in international theory such as vulnerability, security, and domination, as well as the ethics of war.},

abstract = {Recent research in the social sciences has explicitly addressed the challenge of bringing violence back into the center of attention. This has generated substantive progress in terms of both theoretical debate and methodological approaches. However, there is a significant lack of research applying non-reductionist methodological approaches that can, at the same time, be grounded in a theoretical approach to violence as a research subject in its own right. This focus section seeks to address this research gap by strengthening the dialogue between different bodies of literature that pursue disparate strategies of delineating “violence” as the subject of an emerging field of sociology. By synthesizing these literatures, the focus section aims to draw upon insights from social theory and recent developments in the sociology of violence on the one hand, and combine methodological approaches that transcend both micro-and macro-reductionist accounts on the other. In doing so, it offers analytical perspectives for coming to terms with one of the most conspicuous shortcomings in social scientific appraisals of violence: the tendency to treat it as a primarily moral or political problem, instead of conceiving violence as a social fact.},

abstract = {Overcoming actual violence is the driving, although hidden force behind modern modes of thought and investigation, the conceptualisation of civil society since Hobbes, Ferguson and Rousseau, and the unprecedented global effort at preserving human dignity in non-violent politics based on human rights undertaken in the 20th -century. It can even be argued that sociology as a discipline emerged from philosophy precisely as an attempt to contain violence by means of understanding the ways in which people can peacefully co-exist in a society. And yet violence itself is a phenomenon traditionally avoided by sociology. This thesis approaches the issues related to violence through the prism of the ways in which practitioners working in support of survivors endeavour to understand the problem. It is thus a second order critical study of sociological explorations of violence. The thesis begins by mapping the field of sociological exploration of the problem and reviewing the debates related to the theorisation and research of violence. In destabilising the category, the theoretical component of the thesis reveals that the process of understanding violence is a non-linear, always incomplete, and difficult process. The empirical research looks at the approach of practitioners in dealing with the consequent contradictions and ambiguities. Its findings show that in order to link understanding violence and supporting the survivors, one needs to define violence dynamically through the concept of trauma and to build a containing framework in which a holding environment can emerge. The holding environment is presented as a concept, which in practice demonstrates that the understanding employed to address violence is not simply an activity of mind but a social and relational category. This requires re-considering the properties of understanding violence and their linkage with other activities of mind in the social realm and with the practicalities of living. The thesis finishes with a recommendation for further research into the collective aetiology of the trauma derived from violence, for the purposes of designing an approach to sociology based on understanding as a non- violent response to violence.},

This approach regrettably and inexcusably tends to prioritise the agent performing the act of violence in question. This paper argues that we should resist this tendency, in order to prioritise the victim or survivor of violence, and her personal experience, not that of the perpetrator. Starting from an analysis of the devastating impact of violence that characterises the experience of sexual violation and its aftermath, based on the memoirs of Susan Brison (philosopher) and Alice Sebold (novelist), we will then proceed to argue that violence should not be thought of merely in terms of an 'act', but also as an 'experience', the difference being that an act is temporally determinate while an experience is temporally indeterminate. With the help of a phenomenological approach, we will argue that violence has time-indeterminate intended and unintended consequences; these are the ripples of violence. Finally, some of the moral, legal and political implications of acknowledging the temporal indeterminacy of violence will be highlighted.},

abstract = {Emotions can drive intergroup behavior, including intergroup violence. We propose that anger, contempt, and disgust (ANCODI) work together in combination to motivate action, devaluation of the other group, and then elimination of their members. We tested the ANCODI hypothesis by examining speeches given by leaders of extreme political groups prior to major events or rallies that either turned violent (e.g., Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany) or did not (e.g., Gandhi's Salt March in India). Three studies assessed these speeches in the year prior to the critical event and coded for verbal and nonverbal emotional and emotional-appraisal content in references to the nemesis group. Amounts of all three of the ANCODI emotions and their precursor appraisals, in text or video, were elevated 3 months prior to violent events, whereas only anger was elevated prior to nonviolent events. These results suggest that leaders using the ANCODI emotions can generate violence against others, and that identifying this combination prior to an event may facilitate interventions to reduce intergroup violence.},

Three main lines of research have materialized from this overview. First, one line of research is concerned with the difference between the old patterns of violence and the so-called new violence. Second, a line of research focuses on the state's responses to violence. Third, a similar, although much broader, line of research focuses on the public's responses to violence. The article describes a number of paradoxes and paradigms around the study of violence in the region.

Leyendo este libro, he pensado que se podr{\'{i}}an aplicar las preguntas de Klugel y Smith al estudio sobre la violencia y adem{\'{a}}s, agregarle algunas relevantes.

1. ¿Qu{\'{e}} es lo que se justifica? (punto de partida)

Respuesta: La violencia

Pregunta subsiguiente: ¿Qu{\'{e}} es la violencia?

Buffachi (2007):
- Violencia como el uso de la fuerza fisica y el da{\~{n}}o
- Violencia como la violaci{\'{o}}n de derechos
- Violencia como la violaci{\'{o}}n de la integridad

*Nota*: Incluir problematizaci{\'{o}}n sobre tipos de violencia. Revisar Heitmeyer y Hagan (2005) de nuevo.

Pregunta a problematizar: ¿El ambito analitico y moral de la violencia se deben considerar juntos o separados?

2. ¿Qu{\'{e}} argumentos/principios se utilizan para argumentar en torno a lo que se justifica? (discusi{\'{o}}n teorica)

Esta pregunta trae dos preguntas implicitas. La primera es ¿Qu{\'{e}} argumentos llevan a justificar la violencia?

Seg{\'{u}}n Buffachi (2007): Hay tres argumentos principales.

a. Violencia para la justicia
a.1 Argumento para la necesidad
a.2 Argumento estrategico

b. El argumento de la identidad
c. El argumento consecuencialista

Seg{\'{u}}n Frazer y Hutchings (2019):

Consecuencialista
Right-based
Duty-based
Por necesidad

Perspectiva fenomenol{\'{o}}gica y Arendt no s{\'{e}} como abordarla conceptualmente

Y la segunda pregunta refiere a ¿Qu{\'{e}} tipo de violencia es justificada y cuanto? 

Buffachi (2007):

- Fundamental Principle
- Principle of Self Defence
- Principle of Reasonable Sucess
- Principle of Proportionality
- Principle of Last Resort
- Principle of Gradual Progression or Escalation

3. ¿Qu{\'{e}} factores inciden en la justificaci{\'{o}}n de la violencia? (pregunta empirica, sociol{\'{o}}gica, aporte)

Dos preguntas subsiguietes a esta pueden ser:

¿Qu{\'{e}} tipo de factores (sociales-contextuales, individuales, pol{\'{i}}ticos)?

¿C{\'{o}}mo var{\'{i}}an esos factores en el tiempo?

4. ¿Cu{\'{a}}les son las consecuencias de esas jsutificaciones? (relevancia)


Otras preguntas relevantes (especialmente en terminos metodol{\'{o}}gicos) pueden ser:
¿Qui{\'{e}}n hace la justificaci{\'{o}}n?
¿Cu{\'{a}}ndo se hace la justificaci{\'{o}}n?},

abstract = {We develop and validate a scale that measures support for violence in the context of an asymmetrical intergroup conflict between the Chilean state and the largest ethnic minority group in Chile, the Mapuche people: the scale of Support for Violence in an Intergroup Conflict (SVIC). The proposed scale has two dimensions that capture the perceived acceptability of violence carried out in both directions: support for violence carried out by radical Mapuche activists and support for violence carried out by the police in the name of the Chilean state. We validate the scale in a survey conducted using two independent samples: a sample of Mapuche (n1 = 199) and a sample of non-indigenous Chilean respondents (n2 = 195). We test measurement invariance of the scale and find evidence that it is a valid instrument across both samples. Furthermore, findings suggest that the scale has discriminant validity, i.e., it correlates weakly with aggressiveness; as well as convergent validity, i.e., support for violence carried out by Mapuche activists correlates positively with Mapuche identification and negatively with Chilean identification, and the reverse is true for support for violence carried out by the police. We finish by highlighting the importance of measuring support for violence in the context of an asymmetrical intergroup conflict considering violence carried out by the different parties involved in the conflict, as well as the importance of validating the scale considering samples of representatives of both parties.},

abstract = {I discuss the justification of political violence even within democracies. I define ‘violence' and indicate how its evaluative force sometimes has conceptually distorting effects. Though acts of violence are at least prima facie wrong, circumstances can arise where, even in democracies, some of them are morally justified. To establish this, three paradigm cases of non-revolutionary political violence are examined. The question is then discussed whether revolutionary violence is ever justified as a means of establishing or promoting human freedom and happiness. I state the conditions which must be satisfied for such violence to be justified and argue that sometimes these conditions have been satisfied. Finally I argue that discussions of violence are frequently confused by ideological mystification and attempt to go some way towards revealing the sources of that mystification. {\textcopyright} 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Por lo que voy viendo, parece ser bastante argumentable que la desobediencia civil se jsutifica,porque tenemos el deber moral de seguir leyes justas y la responsabilidad de desobedecer las injsutas. La pregunta es ¿cu{\'{a}}n eso se convierte en violencia y si se mantiene tal jsutificaci{\'{o}}n¡?

Considerando el argumento de Thoreau de que se puede rechazar moralmente la ley, pero sigue respetandose su mandato legal (y por ende pueder terminar en la carcel) y tambi{\'{e}}n el argumento de que la desobediencia civil es un elemento importante parahacer leyes, tiendo a pensar lo siguiente:

Eso significa que si uno quiere que una ley cambie porque la cosindera injusta debe protestar contra ella y desobedecerla (digamos que se protesta contra la AFP), pero tambi{\'{e}}n se acepta que esa forma de desobediencia civil reconoce el poder legal del Estado ¿eso signfica que yo deber{\'{i}}a aceptar queme repriman fuerzas del Estado? Esdecir, ¿los argumentos presentados para la desobediencia civil justifican la violencia hecha por el estado?

¿Con quien peleo?
Con aquellos que creen que la violencia es univoca o que dan por sentado definiciones de violencia. Esto implica qe en la introducci{\'{o}}n y problematizaci{\'{o}}n adem{\'{a}}s de se{\~{n}}alar que la violencia es conceptualmente compleja, puedo abordar el argumento de que eso la hace ser ambigua en su aplicabilidadpara referirse a determinadas situaciones sociales.},

Sense of Justice, defined as the relationship between one's actual reward and his/her deserved reward, is reflected in three interrelated but distinct categories: instrumental, relational and procedural. The study was carried out in Israel among over 5000 middle school students in a national sample of 48 public schools. Findings basically support our hypothesis that students, who feel that they were treated fairly by their teachers, will be more trustful. However, these relationships are differential in the comparison of students in three school's sectors: Jewish general, Jewish religious, and Arab.},

abstract = {Contending that justice experiences in school serve as a hidden curriculum that conveys messages about the wider society and impact student attitudes and behavior, we investigate the effects of students' sense of distributive and (school) procedural justice on democratic-related attitudes: liberal democratic orientation (civil rights), social trust and institutional trust. The study was carried out among about 5,000 8th- and 9th-grade students in a national sample of 48 junior high schools in Israel in the 2010-2011 school year. The two-level data-individual and school-were analyzed by the hierarchical linear model (HLM7) program. Findings basically support our hypotheses: sense of distributive instrumental and, especially, of relational justice at school have a positive effect on liberal democratic orientation and on trust in people and in formal institutions. Furthermore, school (aggregate) sense of procedural justice adds to these positive effects and, in the case of democratic orientation, also interacts with instrumental justice and intensifies its effect on this outcome. However, these attitudes are also dependent on sectorial affiliation (Jewish secular, Jewish religious, Israeli-Arab), which explains a considerable portion of between-school variation in student attitudes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Adult citizenship requires a gradual acquisition of political culture—knowledge, attitudes, skills and patterns of behavior necessary to engage in political action. This is especially the case in democratic societies, which are based on citizens' participation. Hence, education for citizenship is uniformly considered as a major mission of the common school, along with its central task of imparting knowledge. In this paper we add to the abundant empirical work on the contributing factors to and behavioral consequences of civic education, focusing on the role of the students' sense of justice in school. We refine previous approaches by distinguishing among three dimensions of the sense of justice, two pertaining to the distributive, and one to the procedural justice. We investigate the effects of these dimensions on four kinds of civic behavior relevant to school life: academic dishonesty, violence, extracurricular activity in school and community volunteering. The study was carried out among about 5000 Israeli middle school students (8th and 9th grades). Findings suggest that, overall, students who perceive their teachers as just tend to refrain from violence and to engage to a greater extent in extra-curricular school activity and community volunteering.},

@article{Gerber2017b,
abstract = {Under what conditions do people support police use of force? In this paper we assess some of the empirical links between police legitimacy, political ideology (right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and support for ‘reasonable' use of force (e.g. an officer striking a citizen in self-defence) and ‘excessive' use of force (e.g. an officer using violence to arrest an unarmed person who is not offering violent resistance). Analysing data from an online survey with US participants (n = 186) we find that legitimacy is a positive predictor of reasonable but not excessive police use of force, and that political ideology predicts support for excessive but not reasonable use of force. We conclude with the idea that legitimacy places normative constraints around police power. On the one hand, legitimacy is associated with increased support for the use of force, but only when violence is bounded within certain acceptable limits. On the other hand, excessive use of force seems to require an extra-legal justification that is–at least in our analysis–partly ideological. Our findings open up a new direction of research in what is currently a rather sparse psychological literature on the ability of legitimacy to ‘tame' coercive power.},

abstract = {Attempts to theorise interpersonal violence inevitably lead scholars to speculate about the causes or explanations for a presumed universal phenomenon: 'violence'. Text after text follows this approach, almost to the level of orthodoxy. In general, theorising about violence coalesces around individual violent offenders. Explanations are grouped by discipline, with each 'cause' critiqued by author after author, who demonstrates the (small) proportion of interpersonal violence in so-called advanced, civilised societies that these theories might explain (and by implication that proportion of violence which cannot be explained): Biological explanations lead to research into the causes of violence that inquires, for instance, into the genetic make-up, chemical levels in the brain or the hormone levels of identified violent males or females.},

abstract = {Are there any commonalities between such phenomena as soccer hooliganism, sabotage by peasants of landlords' property, road rage, and even the events of September 11? With striking historical scope and command of the literature of many disciplines, this book seeks the common causes of these events in collective violence. In collective violence, social interaction immediately inflicts physical damage, involves at least two perpetrators of damage, and results in part from coordination among the persons who perform the damaging acts. Charles Tilly argues that collective violence is complicated, changeable, and unpredictable in some regards, yet also results from similar causes variously combined in different times and places. Pinpointing the causes, combinations, and settings helps to explain collective violence and also helps to identify the best ways to mitigate violence and create democracies with a minimum of damage to persons and property. Charles Tilly is the Joseph L. Buttenwieser Professor of Social Science at Columbia University. He has published more than twenty scholarly books, including twenty specialized monographs and edited volumes on political processes, inequality, population change and European history.},
