abstract = {This article develops a unified framework, based on Rossi's factorial survey method, for studying positive beliefs and normative judgments. The framework enables estimation of individuals ' positive-belief and normative-judgment equations, leading to analysis of the components of beliefs and judgments, assessment of interpersonal variability in the components, and estimation of two further equations, representing, respectively, the determinants and consequences of the components. We describe procedures for data collection, assemble a set of tools for estimating the positive-belief and normative-judgment equations and carrying out the corresponding homogeneity tests, and propose ways of estimating the determinants and consequences equations. To illustrate the framework, we investigate both a positive-belief equation (describing adolescents' views concerning determination of marital happiness) and a normative-judgment equation (describing judgments of the justice of earnings). This article thus provides a guide to contemporary factorial survey analysis, and points the way to its further development. {\textcopyright} 2006 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {What attitudes relating to differences in occupational earnings did people in state-socialist societies hold before and after the transformation in 1989, compared with people in market-regulated societies? And, how can differences between and changes within these societies in attitudes towards income inequality be explained? To find out, hypotheses are tested using survey data from the International Social Survey Programme, comparing several state-socialist societies with several market societies both before (1987) and after (1992) the political and economic transformation. Before the transformation, the public in central and eastern Europe was much more egalitarian than in market-regulated societies. The results show that the amount of income inequality that people think legitimate has increased in all countries, but the increase was far more dramatic in former state-socialist than in market-regulated societies. Differences in the class and demographic composition of the population hardly explain variations in inequality attitudes between societies, but differences in perceptions of income inequality do.},

@article{Wilkinson2004,
abstract = {The most well-established environmental determinant of levels of violence is the scale of income differences between rich and poor. More unequal societies tend to be more violent. If this is a relation between institutional violence and personal violence, how does it work and why is most of the violence a matter of the poor attacking the poor rather than the rich? This paper begins by showing that the tendency for rates of violent crime and homicide to be higher where there is more inequality is part of a more general tendency for the quality of social relations to be poorer in more hierarchical societies. Research on the social determinants of health is used to explore these relationships. It is a powerful source of insights because health is also harmed by greater inequality. Because epidemiological research has gone some way towards identifying the nature of our sensitivity to the social environment and to social status differentials in particular, it provides important insights into why violence is related to inequality. The picture that emerges substantiates and explains the common intuition that inequality is socially corrosive. With an evolutionary slant, and informed by work on ranking systems in non-human primates, this paper focuses on the sharp distinction between competitive social strategies appropriate to dominance hierarchies and the more affiliative social strategies associated with more egalitarian social structures. The implications for policy seem to echo the importance to the quality of life of the three inter-related dimensions of the social environment expressed in the demand for "liberty, equality, fraternity." {\textcopyright} 2004 New York Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {In this book David Mansley argues that the frequency with which violence intrudes on to the streets is related to both how society is governed and how it is policed. With the help of an innovative methodology, he quantifies and tests three variables - collective violence, democracy and protest policing - using protests in Great Britain in 1999-2011, for his sampling frame. The result is the design of new tools of measurement and a harvest of new data, including previously unpublished details of banning orders and riot damages, that enable us to reflect, with the benefit of broad sociological perspective, on the causes of contemporary violent events. Mansley's explanation of the trends he identifies draws from the work of the best thinkers on violence - especially Charles Tilly, Thomas Hobbes and Norbert Elias. He shows how the style of protest policing and the depth of democracy, both of which function under the direction of the political economy, are crucial to the state's credentials as the monopoly supplier of legitimate violence. His discussion touches on such current topics as the institution of police commissioners, the privatisation of policing duties, and the decline in homicide. This cultured study, which includes an engaging review of the existing scholarship on violence, is essential material for undergraduate and postgraduate students reading criminology, sociology or political theory. {\textcopyright} 2014 David R.

@article{Liebig2001,
abstract = {More and more scholars of social justice have been calling for a closer collaboration between empirical and normative disciplines. Psychological and sociological research, as well as philosophical theories can, so they claim, learn from one another and work should be based on results obtained in the other fields of research. Some political philosophers do not share this view. They argue that, since most empirical research does not capture people's moral views on justice, its results cannot be of any value to their theories. Based on this critique I suggest in the first part of this paper that empirical research should distinguish between two classes of justice judgments: First, "justice judgments" in a narrow sense, which are made under conditions of impartiality and grounded in moral principles, and second, "justice attitudes," which differ from other types of social attitudes only in their attitude objects. In the second part I present a quasi-experimental study that aimed at testing the two different classes of justice judgments empirically. The results show that justice judgments in the narrow sense can be obtained even under conditions in which complex experimental manipulations cannot be employed. In the third part of this paper I hypothesize that justice judgments which are based on the two formal criteria provided by political philosophy (impartiality and reference to moral principles) may serve as important intervening variables when trying to explain the impact of justice beliefs on different patterns of human behavior. {\textcopyright} 2002 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {Based on earlier, mainly aggregate analyses, conventional wisdom previously held that income inequality reduces happiness. But aggregate models consistently yield misleading results in this domain, substantially because of intractable problems of sample size, confounding omitted variables, and conditional effects differing between poor developing nations, rich advanced nations, and nations in transition from Communism. Based on more recent evidence, scholarly views are beginning to merge on a consensus that national income inequality is irrelevant to individuals' subjective well-being in advanced nations and normal times, as shown by multi-level models with appropriate controls (including socioeconomic development, an engine of happiness and foe of inequality). For developing nations, consensus is not as strong, but the bulk of the evidence indicates a neutral to positive effect for inequality. Building on this foundation, this paper provides exploratory analyses to stimulate future research, extending our understanding of the social psychological and cultural forces that generate these results; dissects changes over time and expectations for the future; and addresses the possibility that inequality may reduce well-being in extraordinary circumstances and for particular groups – for example creating differences in formerly Communist nations between the political left and the right, and between older and younger cohorts.},

Though an association between attitudes and violent behavior has been demonstrated, most studies have used correlational/observational research designs. We conducted a randomized experiment to test the effect of attitudes toward violence on violent behavior with 285 men from the community. Participants were randomly assigned to receive material to make attitudes toward violence more negative or to a control condition. Violent behavior was then approximated by asking participants to select from a range of violent and nonviolent options in response to a series of interpersonal conflict vignettes. Participants in the negative attitude condition responded with less violence on the vignette questionnaire than did participants in the control condition (Cohen's d = −0.23, 95% CI [−0.46, 0.01]). Participants also completed a measure of attitudes toward violence at the end of the experiment; more positive attitudes toward violence showed a strong association with more violent responding on the vignette questionnaire (r =.62, 95% bootstrapped CI [.54,.69]). Consistent with theory and practice, our findings suggest that attitudes toward violence may play a role in violent behavior.},

abstract = {Among students of social movements, the prevailing view is that, in Western democracies, most social movements target the state and its institutions. Recently scholars have questioned this definition of social movements, associated with the political process and contentious politics approaches, arguing that public protest is also used to shape public opinion, identities, and cultural practices and to pressure authorities in institutional arenas not directly linked to the state. In this paper, we take up this debate by examining the targets of recent social movements. Our analysis draws from data on 4,654 protest events that occurred in the United States between 1968 and 1975. The protest events in our dataset encompass a variety of tactics used by social movements organized around a number of different issues. We find that, although virtually all movements in the United States direct some public protest at the state, there is considerable variation in the targets of modern movements. During this period, environmental, peace, international human rights, single-policy, and ethnic movements were more likely to direct their appeals to the government, while the civil rights, gay and lesbian, and the women's movement were more likely to target public opinion and other, non-state institutions. Our analysis calls into question excessively state-centered conceptions of social movements that view social movement activity as directed primarily at the formal political domain of social life. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We develop and validate a scale that measures support for violence in the context of an asymmetrical intergroup conflict between the Chilean state and the largest ethnic minority group in Chile, the Mapuche people: the scale of Support for Violence in an Intergroup Conflict (SVIC). The proposed scale has two dimensions that capture the perceived acceptability of violence carried out in both directions: support for violence carried out by radical Mapuche activists and support for violence carried out by the police in the name of the Chilean state. We validate the scale in a survey conducted using two independent samples: a sample of Mapuche (n1 = 199) and a sample of non-indigenous Chilean respondents (n2 = 195). We test measurement invariance of the scale and find evidence that it is a valid instrument across both samples. Furthermore, findings suggest that the scale has discriminant validity, i.e., it correlates weakly with aggressiveness; as well as convergent validity, i.e., support for violence carried out by Mapuche activists correlates positively with Mapuche identification and negatively with Chilean identification, and the reverse is true for support for violence carried out by the police. We finish by highlighting the importance of measuring support for violence in the context of an asymmetrical intergroup conflict considering violence carried out by the different parties involved in the conflict, as well as the importance of validating the scale considering samples of representatives of both parties.},

@article{Markovsky2012,
abstract = {We offer the first comparison between "direct" and "indirect" methods for measuring perceptions of distributive justice in reward allocations. The direct method simply asks respondents what they would consider to be a fair salary for a particular person in a given set of circumstances. In contrast, the indirect method infers fair salaries from respondents' judgments about the relative unfairness of hypothetical salaries. The particular indirect method that we will assess is a vignette survey technique pioneered by Jasso and Rossi (1977) and used in a number of more recent publications. The vignettes describe characteristics of a hypothetical employee, with the objective of deriving what respondents believe to be the just reward for that employee. Our experimental test suggests that the two methods yield incompatible results and that neither is immune to bias. The indirect method also suffers from a type of specification error that leads to untenable results. We conclude by suggesting directions for new research to gain a better understanding of these problems and, ultimately, to circumvent them. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {This review of the literature is a cross-disciplinary and systematic analysis of the concept of violence in human societies. The article provides a framework for understanding the phenomenon of violence in such areas as: sociology, political science, anthropology, and philosophy. Two main concept types of violence definitions were differentiated, described, and examined: the narrow and the broad. The narrow definition of violence is characteristic mainly in the political science field, where violence is defined as the unauthorized (illegal, unlawful) use of physical force. The broad definition of violence is associated with sociology, anthropology, and philosophy. The broad concepts are strongly varied in scope and content, including numerous phenomena, such as hate speech, structural and cultural violence, and other manifestations of latent violence, including: iconic violence, media and symbolic violence. Politically motivated violence is a special kind of violence. This is a paradoxical phenomenon - condemned and at the same time indispensable in contemporary political systems and democratic regimes. The review gives rise to different ideas and ways of defining the concept of violence. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Effects of uncertainty salience, ingroup identification, and disruptive versus nondisruptive protest were also investigated. In Study 1, college students who were exposed to an uncertainty salience manipulation and who scored higher on system justification were less likely to protest against the governmental bailout of Wall Street. In Study 2, May Day protesters in Greece who were primed with a system-justifying stereotype exhibited less group-based anger and willingness to protest. In Study 3, members of a British teachers union who were primed with a "system-rejecting" mind-set exhibited decreased system justification and increased willingness to protest. The effect of system justification on nondisruptive protest was mediated by group-based anger. Across very different contexts, measures, and methods, the results reveal that, even among political activists, system justification plays a significant role in undermining willingness to protest. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.},

abstract = {Under what conditions do people support police use of force? In this paper we assess some of the empirical links between police legitimacy, political ideology (right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and support for ‘reasonable' use of force (e.g. an officer striking a citizen in self-defence) and ‘excessive' use of force (e.g. an officer using violence to arrest an unarmed person who is not offering violent resistance). Analysing data from an online survey with US participants (n = 186) we find that legitimacy is a positive predictor of reasonable but not excessive police use of force, and that political ideology predicts support for excessive but not reasonable use of force. We conclude with the idea that legitimacy places normative constraints around police power. On the one hand, legitimacy is associated with increased support for the use of force, but only when violence is bounded within certain acceptable limits. On the other hand, excessive use of force seems to require an extra-legal justification that is–at least in our analysis–partly ideological. Our findings open up a new direction of research in what is currently a rather sparse psychological literature on the ability of legitimacy to ‘tame' coercive power.},

@article{Robinson1983,
abstract = {Through an exploratory analysis of small matched samples in England and the USA, I propose and test the propositions that people's perceptions of the extent of class and racial inequality in their society arise from (1) their differential placement in the stratification system, (2) their acceptance or rejection of dominant ideologies about inequality, (3) their differential educational experiences, and (4) the historical conditions prevailing when their attitudes were being formed. The results suggest that Americans may be more perceptive than the English of both class and racial inequality and may also be more divided on the question of how much inequality exists. In both countries, however, consciousness of inequality may fail to materialize at the most basic level: Many people do not perceive their society to be particularly unequal in the first place, and hence never get beyond this stage to evaluate inequality as unfair, recognize that something can be done about it, and take action to reduce it.

annote = {Apuntes generales

Leyendo este libro, he pensado que se podr{\'{i}}an aplicar las preguntas de Klugel y Smith al estudio sobre la violencia y adem{\'{a}}s, agregarle algunas relevantes.

1. ¿Qu{\'{e}} es lo que se justifica? (punto de partida)

Respuesta: La violencia

Pregunta subsiguiente: ¿Qu{\'{e}} es la violencia?

Buffachi (2007):
- Violencia como el uso de la fuerza fisica y el da{\~{n}}o
- Violencia como la violaci{\'{o}}n de derechos
- Violencia como la violaci{\'{o}}n de la integridad

*Nota*: Incluir problematizaci{\'{o}}n sobre tipos de violencia. Revisar Heitmeyer y Hagan (2005) de nuevo.

Pregunta a problematizar: ¿El ambito analitico y moral de la violencia se deben considerar juntos o separados?

2. ¿Qu{\'{e}} argumentos/principios se utilizan para argumentar en torno a lo que se justifica? (discusi{\'{o}}n teorica)

Esta pregunta trae dos preguntas implicitas. La primera es ¿Qu{\'{e}} argumentos llevan a justificar la violencia?

Seg{\'{u}}n Buffachi (2007): Hay tres argumentos principales.

a. Violencia para la justicia
a.1 Argumento para la necesidad
a.2 Argumento estrategico

b. El argumento de la identidad
c. El argumento consecuencialista

Seg{\'{u}}n Frazer y Hutchings (2019):

Consecuencialista
Right-based
Duty-based
Por necesidad

Perspectiva fenomenol{\'{o}}gica y Arendt no s{\'{e}} como abordarla conceptualmente

Y la segunda pregunta refiere a ¿Qu{\'{e}} tipo de violencia es justificada y cuanto? 

Buffachi (2007):

- Fundamental Principle
- Principle of Self Defence
- Principle of Reasonable Sucess
- Principle of Proportionality
- Principle of Last Resort
- Principle of Gradual Progression or Escalation

3. ¿Qu{\'{e}} factores inciden en la justificaci{\'{o}}n de la violencia? (pregunta empirica, sociol{\'{o}}gica, aporte)

Dos preguntas subsiguietes a esta pueden ser:

¿Qu{\'{e}} tipo de factores (sociales-contextuales, individuales, pol{\'{i}}ticos)?

¿C{\'{o}}mo var{\'{i}}an esos factores en el tiempo?

4. ¿Cu{\'{a}}les son las consecuencias de esas jsutificaciones? (relevancia)


Otras preguntas relevantes (especialmente en terminos metodol{\'{o}}gicos) pueden ser:
¿Qui{\'{e}}n hace la justificaci{\'{o}}n?
¿Cu{\'{a}}ndo se hace la justificaci{\'{o}}n?},

abstract = {The received view in mainstream philosophy is that violence is an 'act', to be defined in terms of 'force' and 'intentionality'. This approach regrettably and inexcusably tends to prioritise the agent performing the act of violence in question. This paper argues that we should resist this tendency, in order to prioritise the victim or survivor of violence, and her personal experience, not that of the perpetrator. Starting from an analysis of the devastating impact of violence that characterises the experience of sexual violation and its aftermath, based on the memoirs of Susan Brison (philosopher) and Alice Sebold (novelist), we will then proceed to argue that violence should not be thought of merely in terms of an 'act', but also as an 'experience', the difference being that an act is temporally determinate while an experience is temporally indeterminate. With the help of a phenomenological approach, we will argue that violence has time-indeterminate intended and unintended consequences; these are the ripples of violence. Finally, some of the moral, legal and political implications of acknowledging the temporal indeterminacy of violence will be highlighted.},

abstract = {Economic and political trends of the last decades resulted in a general rise in anti-minority populism in Hungary. Anti-minority sentiments have been manifested in violence primarily against the Roma, but also against other target groups. The aim of the current study is to reveal the social psychological mechanisms of justifying intergroup violence against outgroups representing a symbolic or a physical threat. Considering that right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) can legitimize violence agsainst threatening outgroups, we hypothesized that RWA would be more important in explaining justification of intergroup violence than a general propensity for radical action. We tested our hypothesis using computer-assisted personal interviews using a representative sample of 1000 respondents. Using structural equation modelling, we found that RWA was a much stronger predictor of the justification of intergroup violence against both physically and symbolically threatening groups than propensity for radical action. Furthermore, a comparison of the groups also revealed that those who justify violence against symbolically threatening groups were also higher in right-wing authoritarianism. These findings highlight that RWA justifies politically motivated aggression against different target groups in Hungary.},

Second, a line of research focuses on the state's responses to violence. Third, a similar, although much broader, line of research focuses on the public's responses to violence. The article describes a number of paradoxes and paradigms around the study of violence in the region.

abstract = {Much of the literature on torture in recent years takes the position of denouncing the barbarity of torture, while allowing for exceptions to this veto in extreme circumstances. The ticking-bomb argument, where a terrorist is tortured in order to extract information of a primed bomb located in a civilian area, is often invoked as one of those extreme circumstances where torture becomes justified. As the War on Terrorism intensifies, the ticking-bomb argu- ment has become the dominant line of reasoning used by both academics and policy advisers to justify a legalized, state-sponsored program of torture. This paper argues for the unconditional refutation of any attempt to justify torture, without exceptions. We argue against the consequentialist reasoning of the ticking-bomb argument not from a deontological position, but on consequentialist grounds. Empirical evidence suggests that the institutionalization of torture practices creates serious problems. Torture interrogation fails to fulfil its initial purpose as a low-cost life saver, while its long-term potential is the devastation of democratic institutions.},

These models are extremely useful but have rarely incorporated ideological factors—despite the fact that protests occur in societal contexts in which some people are motivated to defend and bolster the status quo whereas others are motivated to challenge and oppose it. We adopt a system-justification perspective to specify when individuals and groups will—and will not—experience moral outrage and whether such outrage will be directed at defenders versus critics of the status quo. We describe evidence that epistemic, existential, and relational needs for certainty, security, and affiliation undermine support for system-challenging protests by increasing system-defensive motivation. We also discuss system-based emotions and backlash against protestors and propose an integrated model of collective action that paves the way for more comprehensive research on the psychological antecedents of social change.},

abstract = {In recent years, scholars have argued that protests that employ nonviolent tactics attract greater support and are therefore more likely to succeed than those that use violence. We argue that how protest tactics are perceived is not a purely objective determination, but can be influenced in part by observer characteristics–in particular, by partisan identity. We conducted a survey experiment on two independent samples through the MTurk platform, randomly assigning protester group identity and tactics. Results show that when controlling for assigned tactics, self-identified Republicans but not Democrats perceive higher levels of violence when a disliked group is protesting. The effect is strongest in regard to tactics that are nominally the least disruptive. The findings have implications for theories of nonviolent protest, the legitimacy of repression, and the prospects for marginal groups to influence policy in polarized societies.},

abstract = {Sharp social inequalities in Latin America persist not only as a result of structural elements, but also because people justify and legitimate them in everyday life. Thus, to overcome inequalities it is necessary that individuals subjectively perceive them as unjust. This is an issue that is especially relevant in Chile, one of the first countries to experience neoliberalism in the 1970s. More than social inequalities as such, which are widely studied by Latin American sociology, this article analyzes social justice as a subjective judgment about inequalities. On the basis of the findings of an empirical game-based research project, the article examines the justice criteria used by ordinary people regarding differences between members of society. The authors argue that according to these subjective criteria, social justice refers to aspects that differ from neoliberal discourse about distributive justice based on equality of opportunity and that procedural justice is also key in ordinary discourses about social justice.},

abstract = {An integrative social identity model of collective action (SIMCA) is developed that incorporates 3 socio-psychological perspectives on collective action. Three meta-analyses synthesized a total of 182 effects of perceived injustice, efficacy, and identity on collective action (corresponding to these socio-psychological perspectives). Results showed that, in isolation, all 3 predictors had medium-sized (and causal) effects. Moreover, results showed the importance of social identity in predicting collective action by supporting SIMCA's key predictions that (a) affective injustice and politicized identity produced stronger effects than those of non-affective injustice and non-politicized identity; (b) identity predicted collective action against both incidental and structural disadvantages, whereas injustice and efficacy predicted collective action against incidental disadvantages better than against structural disadvantages; (c) all 3 predictors had unique medium-sized effects on collective action when controlling for between-predictor covariance; and (d) identity bridged the injustice and efficacy explanations of collective action. Results also showed more support for SIMCA than for alternative models reflecting previous attempts at theoretical integration. The authors discuss key implications for theory, practice, future research, and further integration of social and psychological perspectives on collective action. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Psychological Association.},

Question/Objetive/Proposal
Este trabajo propone una nueva teor{\'{i}}a general de la justicia distributiva, totalmente matem{\'{a}}tica y comprobable, cuyo objetivo expl{\'{i}}cito es la explicaci{\'{o}}n y predicci{\'{o}}n de una amplia gama de fen{\'{o}}menos emp{\'{i}}ricos tanto a nivel individual como social. Esta teor{\'{i}}a se basa en la especificaci{\'{o}}n de la funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia que propuse recientemente (Jasso, 1978)
Este trabajo describe una funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia, emp{\'{i}}ricamente elaborada, para el caso de los ingresos, y sugiere su generalizaci{\'{o}}n al sentimiento de justicia sobre todos los bienes de distribuci{\'{o}}n
El presente documento aborda dos grandes tareas: (1) incrustar la funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia en una teor{\'{i}}a expl{\'{i}}cita de la justicia; y (2) especificar las consecuencias conductuales de la teor{\'{i}}a que permitir{\'{a}}n una prueba independiente de la misma.
Hypothesis
## Main features

Las principales caracter{\'{i}}sticas de la teor{\'{i}}a general de la justicia distributiva propuesta en este documento son las siguientes:

(1) La teor{\'{i}}a s{\'{o}}lo se fija en las evaluaciones de justicia realizadas por los individuos sobre sus propias cuotas de bienes. Es decir, no conceptualiza el fen{\'{o}}meno de la "indignaci{\'{o}}n desinhibida" sobre la injusticia sufrida por otros (v{\'{e}}ase Berger et al., 1972:126, para una discusi{\'{o}}n de esta cuesti{\'{o}}n).

(2) La teor{\'{i}}a general afirma la forma matem{\'{a}}tica de las dos variables predictoras de la funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia, el t{\'{e}}rmino real y el t{\'{e}}rmino justo, pero deja ex{\'{o}}geno su contenido sustantivo.

(3) La teor{\'{i}}a general afirma la funci{\'{o}}n combinatoria para la experiencia de la justicia sobre m{\'{a}}s de un bien a la vez.

(4) La teor{\'{i}}a sugiere que un individuo puede caracterizarse por la magnitud subjetivamente experimentada de justicia o injusticia y por su serie temporal de evaluaciones de justicia; tambi{\'{e}}n sugiere que los fen{\'{o}}menos ob- servables en los individuos var{\'{i}}an con la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia instan- t{\'{a}}nea o con los pa- r{\'{a}}metros de la serie temporal del individuo.

(5) La teor{\'{i}}a sugiere que una puerta social puede, en cualquier momento, estar representada por la distribuci{\'{o}}n de frecuencias de las evaluaciones de justicia instant{\'{a}}neas experimentadas por los individuos en el agregado social; tambi{\'{e}}n sugiere que los fen{\'{o}}menos sociales var{\'{i}}an en funci{\'{o}}n de los par{\'{a}}metros de estas distribuciones in- stant{\'{a}}neas. La variaci{\'{o}}n de los fen{\'{o}}menos sociales a lo largo del tiempo puede entenderse por referencia a los cambios en la distribuci{\'{o}}n de las evaluaciones de justicia

abstract = {Recent research in the social sciences has explicitly addressed the challenge of bringing violence back into the center of attention. This has generated substantive progress in terms of both theoretical debate and methodological approaches. However, there is a significant lack of research applying non-reductionist methodological approaches that can, at the same time, be grounded in a theoretical approach to violence as a research subject in its own right. This focus section seeks to address this research gap by strengthening the dialogue between different bodies of literature that pursue disparate strategies of delineating “violence” as the subject of an emerging field of sociology. By synthesizing these literatures, the focus section aims to draw upon insights from social theory and recent developments in the sociology of violence on the one hand, and combine methodological approaches that transcend both micro-and macro-reductionist accounts on the other. In doing so, it offers analytical perspectives for coming to terms with one of the most conspicuous shortcomings in social scientific appraisals of violence: the tendency to treat it as a primarily moral or political problem, instead of conceiving violence as a social fact.},

First, we demonstrate that normative and non-normative collective action participation can be predicted by different psychological variables. Second, we show that collective action participation has emotional and identity-related consequences for activists that shape their motivation to engage in future action. Third, we illustrate that members of disadvantaged groups are faced with two dilemmas-the dilemma of alternative ways of identity management and the dilemma of affective loyalties towards the outgroup-both of which present barriers to social change by undermining protest intentions. In the final part of the review, we outline an integrative framework that maps out the dynamic processes between antecedents of, barriers to and outcomes of collective action participation and highlight a number of directions for future research.},

@article{Verwiebe2000,
abstract = {This paper attempts to answer the question whether justice evaluations of income inequality in a society are determined more by country differences or by the social position an observer occupies. In very general terms what we study is whether, in shaping justice beliefs, cultural factors are more important than social-structural ones, or vice versa. In view of transformation societies, country differences are conflated with differences in the transformation processes the countries are experiencing. This is why we distinguish different types of transmations with regard to the postcommunist countries of Eastern and Central Europe testing empirically whether these transformation types exert influence on the justice beliefs, and how this influence compares to that of positional effects. With International Social Justice Project (ISJP) data of 1991 and 1996, we study the Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia, Bulgaria, East Germany, and - as a western referent society - West Germany. Main results are that in the early phase of transformation the different transformation types as well as social positions matter in shaping justice evaluations, over time, however, the types of transformation clearly lose influence. In 1996, compared to 5 years earlier, the countries have become similar in that most of the variation in the perception of the income justice must now be attributed to the positional differences of individuals. We conclude that the characteristics of the transformation processes decrease in importance for determining public views about social justice. In this respect, the transformation societies of Eastern and Central Europe may well be on the route to becoming more like western societies. {\textcopyright} 2000 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {Social movements often embrace nonviolent civil disobedience strategies. At the same time, social movements sometimes attract participants with different temperaments and different views on the morality or utility of using violence against police. Moreover, the use of force or procedurally unjust tactics by police may influence these views, instigating rebellion and support for the use of violence against police by protesters. This paper examines the nature and correlates of attitudes toward using violence against police among Occupy DC participants in Washington, DC. Data are drawn from a survey of 136 Occupy DC participants. We provide descriptive statistics that summarise Occupiers' attitudes toward the use of violence against police, and test hypotheses about factors that may be associated with these attitudes. Our findings show that a non-trivial subset of participants appears to embrace the use of violence against police, and that these attitudes toward violence are associated with perceptions of the extent to which police treat protesters in a procedurally unjust manner.},

abstract = {This paper develops a unified framework for studying justice and impartiality – identifying six opportunities for impartiality, four for observers and two for allocators; generating the person-specific impartiality profile, including separate subprofiles for observer and allocator activities; and characterizing groups and societies by the impartiality profiles of their members. The immediate challenge is to measure the six kinds of impartiality. This paper takes a first step, focusing on three kinds of observer impartiality – the classic just-reward impartiality and the two new kinds identified by justice theory, framing impartiality and expressiveness impartiality. Understanding the two new forms of impartiality is important because their absence could destroy the good effects of impartiality in other justice elements. The paper reports the results of three factorial surveys carried out among college students in the United States, assessing the students' just-reward, framing, and expressiveness impartiality with respect to the earnings of fictitious workers. The paper makes three main contributions. Theoretically, it illuminates the marriage of justice and impartiality, leading to new insights and new research avenues. Methodologically, the paper develops new analytic and graphical tools for assessing observer impartiality. Substantively, the paper shows that (1) while just gender gaps in aggregate analyses of college students are almost nil (contrary to the just gaps found among adults), closer respondent-specific analyses indicate an intricate mix of subsets of respondents favoring one or the other gender; (2) framing impartiality by gender is almost universal; and (3) expressiveness impartiality ranges from 28 to 57 percent, with an intriguing mix of results by sample and respondent gender. Overall these results suggest that there may be “little cultures” of justice and impartiality on U.S. college campuses. If that is so – and pending future research on all six kinds of impartiality in a variety of samples across countries and over time and as well with respect to rewards other than earnings, such as grades, bequests, and prison sentences – we have offered a way to measure those cultures and understand them theoretically.},

abstract = {The objective of empirical justice analysis is fourfold: (i) to obtain numerical approximations of the quantities and relations identified by justice theory; (ii) to gauge the extent of interindividual and intergroup variation in the quantities and relations; (iii) to explain their etiology, including the effects of social structure and of the observers position in the stratification structure; and (iv) to assess their behavioral and social consequences. This is the first of two papers whose goal is to begin systematic collection of the methods for empirical justice analysis. In this paper, we start by describing the general four-question framework for studying justice, a framework which can be used to organize the accumulating knowledge in the field and to guide both theoretical and empirical inquiry and which can be applied to disparate justice domains. Next we show how attentiveness to empirical intrusions, such as cognitive distortions, together with further reasonings, transforms the three fundamental quantities of the framework-the actual condition, the just condition, and the justice evaluation-into an expanded set of terms, relations, and specific functions. To provide concrete description of methods, we focus on application of the framework to questions of distributive and retributive justice, noting, however, that some of these methods can directly be used for studying questions of procedural justice and of the just society and may be generalizable to further domains. We derive a set of 18 quantities and eight relations identified by the justice framework, and, to prepare for obtaining numerical approximations, we briefly discuss three types of operations- measurement, estimation, and calculation-and present basic empirical models derived from the framework. In the second paper of this set, we will describe several basic research designs, discuss design-specific procedures for obtaining numerical approximations of the justice quantities and relations, and provide empirical illustration. {\textcopyright} 1997 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

The review also organizes recent theories of the development and persistence of aggressive personality. Personality is conceptualized as a set of stable knowledge structures that individuals use to interpret events in their social world and to guide their behavior. In addition to organizing what is already known about human aggression, this review, using the GAM framework, also serves the heuristic function of suggesting what research is needed to fill in theoretical gaps and can be used to create and test interventions for reducing aggression.},

abstract = {Spheres of Global Justice analyzes six of the most important and controversial spheres of global justice, each concerning a specific global social good. These spheres are democratic participation, migrations, cultural minorities, economic justice, social justice, and intergenerational justice. Together they constitute two constellations dealt with, in this collection of essays by leading scholars, in two different volumes: Global Challenges to Liberal Democracy and Fair Distribution. These essays illustrate each of the spheres, delving into their differences, commonalities, collisions and interconnections. Unlike many writings on global justice, Spheres of Global Justice does not content itself with describing the painful and advantageous effects of the globalization process as being ipso facto a global injustice or a just global order. Rather, this multidisciplinary collection of essays, from a pluralist inspiration, combines empirical analysis with theoretical approaches and ethical principles, paying close attention to two aspects of the effects of the globalization process. These aspects are the causal relationships that lead to such effects and the kinds of obligations, or of normative relationships between global rights and correlative duties, that applies to each specific individual case. This volume illustrates how diverse global obligations are, and how they can be, grounded in diverse relationships (identity, ability to provide help, causal responsibility, past injustices, protection of agency and promotion of independence, etc.). These essays also demonstrate that an ethical global approach has not only international or transnational, but also domestic, local and interpersonal dimensions.},

This article seeks to analyse selected examples of such justifications critically through the lens of applied ethics, specifically the justificatory theories termed deontology and consequentialism. These different approaches to justification, and the ways in which they are employed, tell us much about the self-perceptions, ideologies and psychologies of users of political violence. The paper examines whether different sorts of terrorist groups might be said to gravitate towards one particular justificatory mode rather than the other. To this end, the article presents and analyses actual and typical justificatory arguments used by the Provisional IRA, the Red Army Faction, al-Qaeda and anti-abortion militants.},

abstract = {The existing quantitative literature on war takes the independent nation-state as the self-evident unit of analysis and largely excludes other political types from consideration. In contrast, the authors argue that the change in the institutional form of states is itself a major cause for war. The rise of empires and the global spread of the nation-state are the most important institutional transformations in the modern age. To test this hypothesis, the authors introduce a new data set that records the outbreak of war in fixed geographic territories from 1816 to 2001, independent of the political entity in control of a territory. Analysis of this data set demonstrates that wars are much more likely during and because of these two transformations. For the transformation to the modern nation-state, the authors confirm this hypothesis further with logit regressions that control for variables that have been robustly significant in previous research. The results provide support for the main mechanisms that explain this time dependency. Modern nation-states are ruled in the name of a nationally defined people, in contrast to empires, which govern to spread a faith across the world, to bring civilization to backward people, or to advance the world revolutionary cause. The institution of the nation-state thus introduces incentives for political elites to privilege members of the national majority over ethnic minorities, and for minority elites to mobilize against such political discrimination. The resulting power struggles over the ethno-national character of the state may escalate into civil wars. Interstate wars can result from attempts to protect co-nationals who are politically excluded in neighboring states. The reported research thus provides a corrective to mainstream approaches, which exclude ethnic and nationalist politics as factors that would help understanding the dynamics of war.},

abstract = {The relevance of human values for the study of the motivational sources of interpersonal violent behavior was investigated in various fields of the social sciences. However, several past studies mixed up values with other dimensions like attitudes, norms, or beliefs, and only a few systematically assessed the effect of values on violent behavior relying on a value theory. Furthermore, in other studies, violence was often analyzed as a composite index of different forms of delinquent behavior rather than as violence per se. In the current study we address these gaps in the literature by building upon Schwartz' theory of basic human values. We use it to explain attitudes toward interpersonal violence and interpersonal violent behavior. We analyze data of young people (n = 1,810) drawn from a German study in Duisburg, Germany, which assessed various types of self-reported violent behavior as well as values and attitudes toward violence. We test structural equation models in which we explain interpersonal violent behavior with basic human values, and where attitudes toward interpersonal violent behavior mediate this relation. Results show that self-transcendence and conservation values are associated negatively and power and stimulation values positively with interpersonal violent behavior. In addition, attitudes operate as a partial mediator for the former and as a full mediator for the latter in the relation between values and violent behavior. Despite a dominant association between attitudes and behavior, values themselves can significantly contribute to the explanation of violent behavior.},

abstract = {This research is an empirical study of the legitimacy of economic inequality with a focus on the case of Chile. Chile is an appealing case study in this regard because it has been one of the countries with the highest indexes of economic inequality over the past several decades. Theoretical perspectives based on the rational interest of the median voter have pointed out a negative association between high levels of inequality and legitimacy. Nevertheless, empirical evidence indicates that an unequal distribution of income is not necessarily challenged by the majority of a society, a phenomenon associated with the concept of legitimacy of economic inequality. Most empirical studies of this topic to date have considered social contexts that are not characterized by (comparatively) high levels of income inequality; thus, the impact of the level of inequality on its legitimacy remains largely unclear. The present study aimed at bridging this research gap, guided by the question: How do high levels of income inequality in a society influence the legitimacy of economic inequality? Using data obtained by comparative public opinion projects including the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and the International Social Justice Project (ISJP), this research considered individual preferences for occupational earnings inequality (the just earnings gap) as the main object of study. The central hypothesis was that individual preferences are strongly influenced by contextual standards such as the current income distribution, leading individuals of countries with high levels of inequality to have stronger average preferences for economic inequality (the so-called existential argument). Empirical evidence of legitimacy was related to two central dimensions based on David Beetham's multidimensional concept of legitimacy: (a) consensus regarding the inequality in the distribution of earnings in Chile and (b) the impact of the country level of income inequality on individual preferences for a larger just earnings gap. The empirical analysis provided partial evidence regarding the consensus about inequality in Chile, whereas in an international comparative framework, countries with higher levels of income inequality showed a stronger preference for a larger just earnings gap},

Further, attitudes toward courage and retribution have significant effects on disputatiousness and violence, which explains a substantial portion of SES effects.

Attention is also paid to areas where future research effort might be most productively spent, including identifying substantial gaps where more research is needed, where important debates exist that need research to push toward their resolution, where robust results exist but could be furthered by refinements, and where a more inclusive conceptualization of repression may link the study of repression to other significant literatures. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Annual Reviews.

Using an experimental design that manipulated level of grievance, we asked a sample of 2932 US adult participants to read a vignette, and then to indicate their likelihood of engaging in any form of political action as a result of the experiences portrayed in the vignette. In addition, participants were asked to choose between violent actions and peaceful protest, and to indicate the extent to which each form of action was justified. We found that participants who were in the high grievance condition were more likely to favor taking action, and felt that both forms of action were more justified. Those who were higher on SDO and RWA generally indicated less likelihood of taking any action, although those higher on SDO were more likely to both choose the terror attack and indicate that it was more justified. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Humanism and Terror, Beacon Press, Boston, 1999 We must remember that liberty becomes a false engign - a 'solemn complement' of violence - as soon as it becomes only an idea and we begin to defend liberty instead of free men. (preface xxiv) In contrast, true liberty takes others as they are, tries to understand even those doctrines which are its negation, and never allows itself to judge before understanding. (preface xxiv-xxv) We suggest that every man who undertakes to play a role carries around him, as Diderot said of the actor on the stage, a 'great fantom' in which he is forever hidden, and he is responsible for his role even when he cannot find in it what he wanted to be. (preface xxxii) We argue that an action can produce something else than envisaged, but nevertheless political man assumes its consequences. (preface xxxvi) Forced to choose between action and respect for respect for consciences which are mutually exclusive and yet solicit one another, if the respect is to be meaningful and the action humane, is not our choice always good and always bad? (preface xxxviii) Hegel had admirably expressed the impartiality of the hero who can see well that his adversaries are not necessarily 'wretches', everyone being right in a sense, and accomplishes his task without hoping for everyone's approval, nor his own entirely. (preface xxxix) In the last analysis, the truth from which they are running is that man has no rights over the world, that he is not, to talk like Sartre, 'man by divine right', that he is thrown into an adventure whose happy end is not guaranteed any more than the harmony of mind and will assured in principle. (preface xlii) Terror Once humanism attempts to fulfill itself with any consistency it becomes transformed into its opposite, namely, into violence. (p. 13) The Trials remain on a subjective level and never approach what is called 'true' justice, objective and timeless, because they bear upon facts still open toward the future, which consequently are not yet univocal and only acquire a definitively criminal character when they are viewed from the perspective on the future held by the men in power. (p.27) In the end everyone agrees that political acts are to be judged not only according to their meaning for the moral agent but also according to the sense they acquire in the historical context and dialectical phase in which such acts originate. (p.33) ({\ldots}) in history there is no absolute neutrality or objectivity, that the apparent innocent judgment which states a probability in reality sketches what is possible, and that every existential judgment is a value judgment; even laisser faire involves a commitment. (p.39) [like with De Varela, strong emphasis on identity as an implicit background, formed through action] They are defined less by their ideas than by the position they occupy in the movement of history. A movement's responsibility is determined by the role it plays in a network of events, just as a man's character resides much more in his basic enterprise than in his explicit choices. (p.58) If the role of the intellectual and his outlook is to discover in a given assembly of facts several possible meanings to be evaluated methodically, whereas the politician is the one who with perhaps the fewest ideas perceives most surely the real significance and pattern in a given situation, Bukharin's instability could then be explained in terms of the intellectual's psychology. (p.63) [on personal responsibility] Whatever his goodwill, man undertakes to act without being able to appreciate exactly the objective sense of his action; he constructs his own image of the future which has onlo a probable basis and in reality solicits that future so that he can be condemned for it because the event in itself is not unequivocal. A dialectic whose course is not entirely foreseeable can transform a man's intentions into their opposite and yet one has to take sides from the very start. (p.64) Thus history is not comparable to a machine, but to a living being. There is a science of the revolution, but there is also a revolutionary praxis which that science clarifies but does not replace. There is a spontaneous movement of objective history, but there is also a human intervention which makes it leap stages and which cannot be foretold from theoretical schemas. (p.89) [hunches that point to ct] But the point is that we are not spectators of a closed history; we are actors in an open history, our praxis introduces the element of construction rather than knowledge as an ingredient of the world, making the world not simply an object of contemplation but something to be transformed. What we cannot imagine is a consciousness without a future and a history without an end. Thus, as long as there are men, the future will be open and there will be only a probabilistic calculation and no absolute knowledge. (p.92) [the battle for interpretation and meaning] 'Each self-consciousness aims at the destruction and death of the other,' says Hegel. Inasmuch as self-consciousness gives meaning and value to every object that we can grasp, it is by nature in a state of vertigo and it is a ermanent temptation for it to assert itself as the expense of other consciousnesses who dispute its privilege. (p.102) [microworlds] Between men considered as pure consciousness there would indeed be no reason to choose. But between men considered as the incumbents of situations which together compose a single common situation it is inevitable that one has to choose - it is allowable to sacrifice those who according to the logic of their situation are a threat and to promote those who offer a promise of humanity.(p.110) [MP talking in ct terms]},

abstract = {Overcoming actual violence is the driving, although hidden force behind modern modes of thought and investigation, the conceptualisation of civil society since Hobbes, Ferguson and Rousseau, and the unprecedented global effort at preserving human dignity in non-violent politics based on human rights undertaken in the 20th -century. It can even be argued that sociology as a discipline emerged from philosophy precisely as an attempt to contain violence by means of understanding the ways in which people can peacefully co-exist in a society. And yet violence itself is a phenomenon traditionally avoided by sociology. This thesis approaches the issues related to violence through the prism of the ways in which practitioners working in support of survivors endeavour to understand the problem. It is thus a second order critical study of sociological explorations of violence. The thesis begins by mapping the field of sociological exploration of the problem and reviewing the debates related to the theorisation and research of violence. In destabilising the category, the theoretical component of the thesis reveals that the process of understanding violence is a non-linear, always incomplete, and difficult process. The empirical research looks at the approach of practitioners in dealing with the consequent contradictions and ambiguities. Its findings show that in order to link understanding violence and supporting the survivors, one needs to define violence dynamically through the concept of trauma and to build a containing framework in which a holding environment can emerge. The holding environment is presented as a concept, which in practice demonstrates that the understanding employed to address violence is not simply an activity of mind but a social and relational category. This requires re-considering the properties of understanding violence and their linkage with other activities of mind in the social realm and with the practicalities of living. The thesis finishes with a recommendation for further research into the collective aetiology of the trauma derived from violence, for the purposes of designing an approach to sociology based on understanding as a non- violent response to violence.},

Through a quantitative research synthesisof four motivations for collective action (1,235 effects from 403 samples; total N = 123,707), we summarizeand synthesize this body of research into the dual chamber model, a comprehensive and potentially cross-cultural model of collective action. We aim to replicate previous meta-analytic conclusions (about identity, in justice, and efficacy) and break new theoretical ground by (a) integrating a fourth motivation (morality) into thevery heart of the psychology of collective action, (b) extending these four motivations to advantaged groupmembers acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged, and (c) integrating theoretically relevant structural (i.e.,cultural and other contextual) constraints. Results substantiated the dual chamber model as all four motivationsyielded unique, positive, medium-sized effects and interrelationships were positive (particularly among morality and identity, conceptualized as the dual chambers of the protester's beating heart). Meta-analytic structuralequation modeling supported the added value of including morality. Moreover, findings confirmed that thestrongest specific motivations were emotional injustice and politicized identification, while newly adding moralconviction to that list. Finally, the four motivations extended to advantaged group members acting in solidaritywith the disadvantaged, while only the identity motivation was constrained by theoretically relevant culturaldimensions and values (e.g., collectivism and hierarchy). We discuss the implications and limitations of thedual chamber model for integrative theorizing, innovative research, and the practice of collective action.},

Ever since a growth spurt in the 1980s, however, and despite a very active research enterprise, distributive justice theory has developed very little. Our approach is first to discuss the role that theory plays in disciplinary growth. After noting the indicators of stagnation in distributive justice areas, we identify key problems with the way distributive justice theories are constructed and evaluated. Specifically, little attention is paid to the clear definition and consistent use of theoretical terms, or to the construction of explicit logical arguments from which empirical hypotheses may be derived. Weaknesses in these areas all but prohibit the evolution of improved theories over time. We conclude with a set of evaluative criteria that, if applied collectively by members of the field, would optimize the chances for theoretical progress. Ultimately this also would lead to more efficient empirical tests and be tier-informed practical applications of distributive justice theories. {\textcopyright} 2001 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {By integrating systematically the common themes in the stratification and justice literatures, researchers have sought to advance our understanding of the role of ideologies in legitimating inequality. This paper examines how beliefs about meritocracy and opportunity in American society relate to the way people think about reducing income differences between the rich and the poor. Using a national sample of U.S. adults (N=1473), we find that the majority of the respondents believe that America has an open system where achievement is tied to individual abilities and educational opportunities. On the other hand the respondents are split in their views on meritocracy, with 50% believing that an individual's high socioeconomic position is reflective of special abilities. The role of ideologies in influencing beliefs about economic justice is direct in that persons who believe in the tenets of equal opportunity and meritocracy are not in favor of reducing income differences between the rich and the poor. Additionally, stratal differences in beliefs about economic justice are seen, with disadvantaged individuals more likely to question the legitimacy of inequality. {\textcopyright} 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

Structural equation modeling techniques are used to examine data from a representative sample of the general population and a sample of exoffenders. The findings indicate that experiencing violence while growing up is related to favorable attitudes towards violence against spouses. The experience of violence while growing up and attitudes are related to violence against both children and spouses. The relationship between experiencing violence while growing up and engaging in violence against spouses is mediated by attitudes. The results also suggest that men and nonwhites are more approving of violence towards spouses. However, attitudes do not account for demographic differences in violence against children and spouses.},

abstract = {Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) has been conceptualized and measured as a unidimensional personality construct comprising the covariation of the three traits of authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism. However, new approaches have criticized this conceptualization and instead viewed these three "traits" as three distinct, though related, social attitude dimensions. Here we extend this approach providing clear definitions of these three dimensions as ideological attitude constructs of Authoritarianism, Conservatism, and Traditionalism. These dimensions are seen as attitudinal expressions of basic social values or motivational goals that represent different, though related, strategies for attaining collective security at the expense of individual autonomy. We report data from five samples and three different countries showing that these three dimensions could be reliably measured and were factorially distinct. The three dimensions also differentially predicted interpersonal behaviour, social policy support, and political party support. It is argued that conceptualizing and measuring RWA as a set of three related ideological attitude dimensions may better explain complex sociopolitical phenomena than the currently dominant unidimensional personality based model. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Society of Political Psychology.},

Does a consensual normative framework for judging the fairness of distributions of earn- ings exist in the U.S. population? What principles underlie popular judgments concerning earnings distributions? Data indicate both that judgments of earnings fairness are not idiosyncratic and that they in- volve individual and group differences related to considerations of merit and need. Some tolerance for variation in earnings among house- holds is noted, and the same factors accounting for earnings-fairness judgments justify earnings considered fair. Considerable agreement exists concerning what principles are relevant to earnings-fairness judgments, while disagreement concerning how to apply these stan- dards in practice is admitted. Apparently the standards for earnings judgments derive both from conceptions of the empirical distribution of earnings and from underlying values concerning what is fair and just.},

In this methodological commentary, we argue that the empirical strategy used to reach this conclusion is not fit for purpose because both conceptual stances—possible sources of legitimacy or constituent components of legitimacy—are consistent with the same fitted statistical model. Analysing nationally representative data from 30 countries across Europe and beyond, we also show that erroneous support for the approach to measurement is likely to be found wherever one looks. To be sensitive to cultural context means using a methodology that does not impose the preconditions of legitimacy, and we counsel against a trend starting in international criminology that does precisely the opposite.},

An example for this is the 2018 amendment to the Hungarian Fundamental Law, which openly criminalizes homeless people. In our research, we investigated whether criminalization of homelessness can become a source of justifying violence against homeless people in the Hungarian context. We assumed that right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation would positively predict support for violence against the homeless, and the acceptance of a criminalizing law can serve as a justification for this. Our hypotheses were tested using a convenience (N = 196) and a representative sample of the population of Budapest (N = 674). We found that both RWA and SDO predicted support for violence, and this connection was mediated by the new law. We also found that justification was influenced by educational level, as the association between SDO and violence increased with higher levels of education.},

Though acts of violence are at least prima facie wrong, circumstances can arise where, even in democracies, some of them are morally justified. To establish this, three paradigm cases of non-revolutionary political violence are examined. The question is then discussed whether revolutionary violence is ever justified as a means of establishing or promoting human freedom and happiness. I state the conditions which must be satisfied for such violence to be justified and argue that sometimes these conditions have been satisfied. Finally I argue that discussions of violence are frequently confused by ideological mystification and attempt to go some way towards revealing the sources of that mystification. {\textcopyright} 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Symbolic violence built into a culture does not kill or maim like direct violence or the violence built into the structure. However, it is used to legitimize either or both, as for instance in the theory of a Herrenvolk, or a superior race. The relations between direct, structural and cultural violence are explored, using a violence triangle and a violence strata image, with various types of casual flows. Examples of cultural violence are indicated, using a division of culture into religion and ideology, art and language, and empirical and formal science. The theory of cultural violence is then related to two basic points in Gandhism, the doctrines of unity of life and of unity of means and ends. Finally, the inclusion of culture as a major focus of peace research is seen not only as deepening the quest for peace, but also as a possible contribution to the as yet non-existent general discipline of ‘culturology'. {\textcopyright} 1990, Sage Publications.

A social context of corruption effectively undermined the efficacy and legitimacy of non-violent collective action, relative to support for violence, thereby promoting (indirectly) support for future extreme action.

Building upon current theory and research, justice evaluation is conceived as a comparison of the rewards one receives with rewards s/he expects. Using data from a 1979 Indianapolis area survey, we examine beliefs about inequality and their role in subjective perceptions of distributive justice. We examine the extent to which {\dq}what is{\dq} affects perceptions of {\dq}what ought to be{\dq} using collective beliefs about distribution practices, that is, the extent to which persons perceive departures from justice in terms of existential standards. We find that it is possible to abstract, with a high degree of distinctiveness, a set of aggregate principles representing existential notions about the ways in which individual characteristics are related to household income. We find that this approach to the measurement of reference standards for the evaluation of income receipts has some empirical validity, in that it predicts perceptions of over- vs. under-reward, but such an approach to measuring departures from justice does not produce meaningful variation in measures of satisfaction and acceptance of income.},

The analysis tracks public attitudes toward the police before and after each incident, and examines similarities and differences in the opinions of Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics. The often dramatic increase in unfavorable attitudes toward the police in the wake of highly publicized events suggests that such incidents have a pronounced effect on public opinion. Policy implications are discussed, drawing on citizens' attitudes toward measures that might prevent or reduce the frequency of future incidents of misconduct. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, value differences in former East and West Germany are studied in order to determine which values can be expected to change, perhaps leading to a gradual convergence of East and West, and which values will resist change for some time to come. If it is true, as some observers say, that the unified Germany is still a divided country - not so much in terms of material living conditions but ideologically, it is attempted to predict in what way the ideological "inner wall" is a fact to be reckoned with even in the future. Based on the International Social Justice Project (ISJP) data from 1991 and 1996, the focus is on particular values-on four justice ideologies: egalitarianism, individualism, ascriptivism, and fatalism which are derived from grid-group theory, and it is tested whether these four ideologies form a common set of beliefs in East and West Germany. Results show that they do, but that East and West Germans have very different ideological preferences within this ideological framework. Therefore it is next tested whether the differences are rooted in cultural distinctions between the East and the West or whether they can be explained by the social positions individuals in East and West Germany hold-and by the rational interests attached to these positions. Using a structural equation approach to examine the genuine east-west effects and the structural effects, we find little evidence for cultural differences but ample evidence for social structural determination. From these findings it is concluded that the ideological "inner wall" running through Germany is bound to fall if living conditions on both sides become even more alike. {\textcopyright} 2000 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {Procedural justice theory posits that people care at least as much about how a decision was made as they do about the outcome. Although policymakers and researchers argue that procedural justice-based interventions can improve police-civilian interactions, little research has examined how authorities evaluate decision-making processes. This research examined whether police officers and civilians evaluate fairness in police-civilian encounters through the same mechanisms. 69 police officer and 113 civilian participants, recruited through Qualtrics professional panels and Amazon's Mechanical Turk respectively, read a vignette describing a police-civilian interaction in which the civilian explained why they violated the law (procedural justice) or were interrupted by the officer (procedural injustice) and made evaluations of the interaction. Multiple-group analyses using bootstrapping revealed that both police officers and civilians rated the procedural justice condition as more fair because they rated the officer as more respectful and trustworthy and because they perceived the civilian had more voice than in the procedural injustice condition. Further, direct and indirect pathways through respect were not present when police officer pathways were allowed to vary, suggesting police may rely on social information differently than civilians.},

It began with the assumption that differences in the quality of moral judgment can lead individuals to engage in different forms of collective action: activism or radicalism. Therefore, the associations among the variables political ideology, social identity, perception of social justice, activist identity and commitment, personal political salience, perception of efficacy and life purpose were analyzed. Path modelling was used to construct two models of political action: one based on conventional moral judgment and conservative political ideology, and the other based on post-conventional moral judgment and egalitarian political ideology. These two models were tested on samples of Brazilian and Spanish youths. The results confirmed the validity of using developmental social psychology to understand activism as a form of political action. The results confirmed the central hypothesis that differences in the quality of moral judgment and in political ideology are related to willingness to engage in qualitatively different types of actions: young people with conventional moral judgment and conservative political ideology declared their intention to engage in activism, while young people with post-conventional moral judgment egalitarian political ideology reported the intention to engage in both activist and radical actions.},

abstract = {Does economic inequality breed political violence? For almost half a century, scholars have tried to test this assumption, finding little empirical support for a statistical relationship between the two variables. This article provides a critical review of this literature, starting out with the link between so-called vertical (inter-individual) inequality and conflict. I argue that the lack of empirical results can largely be attributed to the almost exclusive focus on individual-level differences in terms of income or land. Group identity is critical to recruitment and maintaining allegiance to a military organization. Hence, we should focus the attention on the relevant form of inequality- that between groups, or so-called horizontal inequalities. In contrast to the studies focusing on vertical inequality, an emerging quantitative literature on horizontal inequalities and conflict has found a positive link, which is more in line with the evidence from several case studies. However, measuring horizontal inequalities is a clear challenge, and there is a need for additional studies to qualify the initial findings. I conclude by suggesting some avenues for future research. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

We analyzed whether supporting a protest depends on the legitimacy of the advanced claim (i.e. in terms of adherence to democratic principles) or on the legitimacy attributed to that group. One hundred and eighty Italian citizens (45.9 % women; M age = 41.64, SD = 13.69) responded to an online questionnaire concerning a protest movement. The design included 2×2 conditions: non-threatening vs. threatening type of group and unbound vs. restricted protesters' claims. The results showed that support given to the protest is overlooked when the group is perceived as more threatening. However, the perception of the protest group has no effect on value-oriented participants who instead focus on the claims.},

But discerning the just reward is not easy; much intervenes between the idea and its expression. Justice theory suggests four classes of measures, one direct and three indirect, each class encompassing several designs for data collection and data analysis. This paper examines direct designs and one of the three classes of indirect designs-that based on the justice evaluation-and revisits the longstanding challenge of justice-evaluation-based indirect designs, namely, to reduce or eliminate the correlation between the actual reward and the unobserved just reward. The paper presents statistical, algebraic, and empirical evidence to show how the factorial survey, with its layers of randomization, protects against bias, mitigating the correlation in the one-reward design and destroying it in the multiple-reward design. Of course, the search for better measures continues. As with length and weight, new theory and new technology will bring new and better measures of the just reward. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

Por lo que voy viendo, parece ser bastante argumentable que la desobediencia civil se jsutifica,porque tenemos el deber moral de seguir leyes justas y la responsabilidad de desobedecer las injsutas. La pregunta es ¿cu{\'{a}}n eso se convierte en violencia y si se mantiene tal jsutificaci{\'{o}}n¡?

Considerando el argumento de Thoreau de que se puede rechazar moralmente la ley, pero sigue respetandose su mandato legal (y por ende pueder terminar en la carcel) y tambi{\'{e}}n el argumento de que la desobediencia civil es un elemento importante parahacer leyes, tiendo a pensar lo siguiente:

Eso significa que si uno quiere que una ley cambie porque la cosindera injusta debe protestar contra ella y desobedecerla (digamos que se protesta contra la AFP), pero tambi{\'{e}}n se acepta que esa forma de desobediencia civil reconoce el poder legal del Estado ¿eso signfica que yo deber{\'{i}}a aceptar queme repriman fuerzas del Estado? Esdecir, ¿los argumentos presentados para la desobediencia civil justifican la violencia hecha por el estado?

Esto implica qe en la introducci{\'{o}}n y problematizaci{\'{o}}n adem{\'{a}}s de se{\~{n}}alar que la violencia es conceptualmente compleja, puedo abordar el argumento de que eso la hace ser ambigua en su aplicabilidadpara referirse a determinadas situaciones sociales.},

This article analyses the impact that perceptions of injustice in the way authorities treat citizens and the legitimacy of authorities have on attitudes towards normative, e.g., voting in a plebiscite or peacefully protesting, and non-normative, e.g., violent protests or barricades, collective action. We propose a dialogue between the social psychology of social movements and theories of social justice and legitimacy to consider the joint effect of perceived injustices and legitimacy on collective action. We analysed data from a representative sample of the Chilean population (n = 1,805). Through an analysis of structural equations we found that perceived injustice is related to lower beliefs in the legitimacy of authorities, and that this leads to a greater justification for non-normative collective action and lower justification for normative collective action. Results were analysed within the current context of radicalization of social mobilizations throughout the world and in Chile.},

Considered as an alternative to the mainstream accounts of violence, that only sees violence as a physical, visible, intentional, and intersubjective act of harm, a more comprehensive understanding of violence, involving the concept of structural violence, is championed throughout. The concept of structural violence is put forth as an alternative view for recognizing invisible though equally fatal instances of violent actions. It is then combined with Foucault's accounts of power, and especially his concept of bio-power. It has been maintained that two concepts overlap greatly, especially in Foucault's accounts of neoliberal power. In the last chapter, this argument is supported by examples taken from different case studies conducted by different authors that reflect the violent effects of neoliberal practices. Keywo},

abstract = {Among students of social movements, the prevailing view is that, in Western democracies, most social movements target the state and its institutions. Recently scholars have questioned this definition of social movements, associated with the political process and contentious politics approaches, arguing that public protest is also used to shape public opinion, identities, and cultural practices and to pressure authorities in institutional arenas not directly linked to the state. In this paper, we take up this debate by examining the targets of recent social movements. Our analysis draws from data on 4,654 protest events that occurred in the United States between 1968 and 1975. The protest events in our dataset encompass a variety of tactics used by social movements organized around a number of different issues. We find that, although virtually all movements in the United States direct some public protest at the state, there is considerable variation in the targets of modern movements. During this period, environmental, peace, international human rights, single-policy, and ethnic movements were more likely to direct their appeals to the government, while the civil rights, gay and lesbian, and the women's movement were more likely to target public opinion and other, non-state institutions. Our analysis calls into question excessively state-centered conceptions of social movements that view social movement activity as directed primarily at the formal political domain of social life. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Meritocratic attitudes are defined as general beliefs that education and its correlates should determine personal economic outcomes. Using the International Social Survey Project (ISSP): Social Inequality Module (1992), we examine both individual-level and country-level determinants of pro-meritocratic attitudes. According to self-interest and rational-action theories, individuals with high educational attainment and high personal income are expected to have strong meritocratic beliefs because meritocracy is in their best interestthey would gain under such a system. At the same time, both modernization and post-industrial theories imply that persons living in countries with a high degree of societal meritocracy hold stronger meritocratic beliefs than persons living in countries with low degree of societal meritocracy. Results of the Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analysis on a data set including 7,972 persons from 14 countries indicate that the impact of individuals' education and income on meritocratic attitudes occurred as theoretically predicted. We also demonstrate that the relationship between the degree of societal meritocracy and the degree of support for such a system is statistically significant even if national wealth and educational stock (as well as individual-level variables) are controlled. In addition, we discovered that at the beginning of the 1990s a post-communist regime had a negative effect on support for meritocracy. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

Strikingly, the study of distributive justice unites within it all three elements—thinking, saying, doing—granting them their own distinctive substantive importance and specifying their relations. This paper examines the ideas and insights of distributive justice, highlighting their special character as thinking, saying, and doing elements. The stage is set for the growth of knowledge, as theoretical analysis provides theoretical clarification and development and empirical analysis provides ever sharper tests of the propositions and predictions of justice theory.},

Over the past 40 years, the systematic study of state repression has grown considerably. The development of this work, however, has been uneven. Though unified in their focus on the problem of order (i.e., trying to ascertain how political authorities wield coercive power amid potential and actual domestic challengers), different scholars tend to emphasize distinct aspects of the topic. Consequently, a great deal of progress has been made in specific areas but others have lagged behind. In this review, I attempt to identify the dominant traditions in the repression literature, the core empirical findings, and some persisting puzzles.

@phdthesis{Gerber2012,
abstract = {Why do people support the harsh punishment of criminal offenders? This dissertation starts from the premise that views about punishment go far beyond concerns about crime and security. Punishment is a central component of the social order and a means by which social order is produced. It follows that ideological preferences will be crucial in understanding people's punitive reactions. People who have a preference for collective security might support punishment to restore order and cohesion. Yet, by committing crime, offenders also seem to gain power in society and punishment can restore the status quo. Punishment might therefore have positive value for people motivated to achieve social order (people high in right-wing authoritarianism, RWA) as well as for people motivated to achieve power and dominance (people high in social dominance orientation, SDO). In this dissertation I build on criminological and socialpsychological research to propose a dual-motivational model of punitive attitudes. I examine whether the effects of RWA and SDO are mediated by different beliefs about crime and symbolic motives of punishment (Paper 1) and whether they predict different retributive goals of punishment (Paper 2). Finally, I explore the circumstances under which RWA and SDO predict punitive attitudes (Papers 3 and 4). The four papers presented in this dissertation suggest that there are, indeed, two ideological antecedents to punitive attitudes. High RWA individuals favoured harsh punishment to restore collective security, maintain hierarchies and avoid powerful criminals disrupting social order. High SDO's did so to establish and maintain power and status hierarchies in society. However, the effect of SDO was limited to situations where crime was associated with a competitive situation. Punitiveness seems to be related to a groupbased competition for status and power with criminal offenders. Yet, high SDO individuals are not predisposed to think of criminal offenders as threats to hierarchies.},

First we ask whether people use standards or principles of distributive justice regarding the allocation of income. The study confirms our expectation that there are at least two principles, viz., the merit and the need principle. Our data show that there is no generally held consensus about the applicability of these two principles. Second, we looked for explanations to explain variations in adherence to these principles. The literature suggests five different theses: 1. self-interest; 2. ideology; 3. enlightenment; 4. historical shift; and 5. gender. Results provide qualified support for the Theses 1, 2 and 4. Class, ideology, and age affect the preferences for the principles of justice. Further elaboration suggests the data point to a specific version of the self-interest thesis, viz., the underdog thesis. Theses 3 and 5 are not confirmed. Implications of these findings are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

To be sure, there are macro societal mechanisms for reducing inequality. But are there micro mechanisms for reducing inequality? This article first examines inequality measures and behavioral models that produce inequality effects, identifying five sets of inequality mechanisms which lead to levers that ordinary people can use to reduce income inequality, and next discusses the levers, with special attention to their feasibility, ease of use, and side effects. The five levers highlight transfers, equal additions, negative assortative mating, wage schedules that reward multiple personal characteristics, and compensation procedures with voting rules, many voters, diversity of thought, and secret ballots. This work raises new questions for research, such as the sources of diversity of thought.},

Some studies report a just gender pay gap favoring men; others do not find this gap. This study investigates the gender bias in justice evaluations by linking it to the inequality structure in which people are embedded. The empirical analyses are based on three factorial survey studies that consist of fictitious full-time employees with varying characteristics, including gender. One study was conducted with social sciences students, and two used population samples of German inhabitants. The results show that social sciences students revealed no gender bias in their evaluations. In the population surveys, both men and women showed a rating behavior favoring male employees. Respondents living in federal states with high actual gender pay gaps produced a larger bias favoring men. The findings indicate that actual inequalities between men and women influence the gender bias in justice evaluations.},

The sample consists of students pursuing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree in Sweden and the United States. The framework, based on justice theory and making use of Rossi's factorial survey method, enables assessment of ideas of fairness in CEO compensation, including (1) the just CEO compensation, in the eyes of each observer; (2) the principles of microjustice - observers' ideas about 'who should get what' based on characteristics of CEOs and their firms; and (3) principles of macrojustice - ideas about the just level and dispersion in compensation across all CEOs. Our estimates yield the following main results: First, there is broad agreement on the median just CEO compensation but substantial inter-individual variation in the principles of microjustice and the other principles of macrojustice. Second, there is remarkable similarity in the distributions of the principles of microjustice and macrojustice across the MBA groups. Other important results include a pervasive gender attentiveness among MBA students and tolerance for large variability in CEO pay.

abstract = {The study proposes a taxonomy that maps and organizes various normative ("ought") and empirically oriented ("is") theories of distributive justice, with the aim of examining possible relations between these two research traditions. The taxonomy distinguishes between theories according to two shared dimensions of content: (a) microjustice versus macrojustice principles and (b) the unidimensional versus multidimensional character of these principles. The combination of these dimensions yields four groups of theories of distributive justice: unidimensional macro (the utilitarian approach); multidimensional macro (Rawls' theory of justice); unidimensional micro (desert and equity theories); and multidimensional micro (Miller's theory and the multiprinciple approach). A fifth group of hybrid theories is identified (including Walzer's and Jasso's theory of justice), which is built upon the layers of the other taxonomy cells, combining elements of macro- and microjustice and emphasizing the multidimensional character of distributive justice. The analysis revealed that the empirical and normative traditions have much in common. In certain cases, as with the utilitarian approach and Rawls' theory, empirical research has sought correspondence between the "ought" and the "is." In other cases, such as with equity theory and the multiprinciple approach, it has used some basic normative ideas and assumptions as its starting point. Nevertheless, these research traditions often develop in parallel ways without sufficient mutual recognition or interaction. The study concludes by considering possible exchanges that may develop between these two traditions, examining to what extent and how philosophical-normative and empirically oriented research can contribute to one another. {\textcopyright} 2002 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

Moreover, the violent event is structuring the order of the action sequences in an actual violent (embodied) interaction. The interactional dynamics in violent encounters between co-present actors shapes the specific forms of the experiencing in (and of) the violent interaction. Based on how violence is experienced in an interactive situation, the phenomenon of violence articulates itself according to three coordinates: directedness, co-performativity and de-capabilisation. The outlining of the structure of the lived experience of violence is revealing something irreducible in it. To understand the experience of violence as such, I propose that we accept the idea of violence per se and depart from the idea that the acts of violence are essentially moral actions. The core of the ethical-moral discussion concerning violence should be grounded instead on the moment of conversion identifiable when we take into account the reaction to violence.},

This is especially the case in democratic societies, which are based on citizens' participation. Hence, education for citizenship is uniformly considered as a major mission of the common school, along with its central task of imparting knowledge. In this paper we add to the abundant empirical work on the contributing factors to and behavioral consequences of civic education, focusing on the role of the students' sense of justice in school. We refine previous approaches by distinguishing among three dimensions of the sense of justice, two pertaining to the distributive, and one to the procedural justice. We investigate the effects of these dimensions on four kinds of civic behavior relevant to school life: academic dishonesty, violence, extracurricular activity in school and community volunteering. The study was carried out among about 5000 Israeli middle school students (8th and 9th grades). Findings suggest that, overall, students who perceive their teachers as just tend to refrain from violence and to engage to a greater extent in extra-curricular school activity and community volunteering.},

abstract = {Described is a new specification of the justice evaluation function, one that clearly & accurately predicts the kind of injustice (underreward or overreward) & the degree of injustice associated with given departures from perfect justice. The evaluation function was developed empirically from analyses of survey data on the perceived justice or injustice of earnings. Almost 12,000 judgments from a probability sample of 200 Rs were elicited concerning the justice or injustice of earnings received by 600 different fictitious individuals & families. The result was a logarithmic function predicting precisely & unambiguously the magnitude of injustice associated with departures from perfect justice in the distribution of earned income. This formula is proposed as a universal law of justice evaluation in distributional matters. It is suggested that this law performs one of the three tasks essential to a scientific theory of distributive justice: to specify the kind & degree of injustice associated with given departures from justice.

This paper
Este art{\'{i}}culo presenta una nueva especificaci{\'{o}}n respaldada emp{\'{i}}ricamente de la funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia, que predice de manera simple y precisa la magnitud precisa de la injusticia asociada con las desviaciones medidas de la justicia perfecta en la distribuci{\'{o}}n del ingreso del trabajo, y que puede extenderse para cubrir todos los asuntos distributivos
En este trabajo exploro la funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia mediante la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de las magnitudes de injusticia asociadas a determinadas desviaciones de la justicia perfecta
Gap
Los cient{\'{i}}ficos sociales han reconocido desde hace tiempo la importancia de la respuesta a la injusticia (por ejemplo, Homans 1974, 1976; Berger et al. 1972) y han sugerido que juzgarse a s{\'{i}} mismo como sobrepagado produce culpa y juzgarse a s{\'{i}} mismo como mal pagado produce ira. Sin embargo, no han tenido mucho que decir sobre las respuestas a los juicios sobre la injusticia recibidos por otros. Adem{\'{a}}s, el registro emp{\'{i}}rico muestra un apoyo insignificante a la hip{\'{o}}tesis de la culpa (v{\'{e}}ase Adams y Freedman 1976, pp. 45-46)
Relevance
Sugiero aqu{\'{i}} que encontrar la forma "verdadera" de la funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia es una tarea imperativa. No basta con conocer los par{\'{a}}metros de la distribuci{\'{o}}n justa de las ganancias. Vivimos en un mundo que rara vez se da cuenta de la concordancia entre las ganancias reales y las ganancias justas. Las principales cuestiones de la vida social no se limitan a cuestiones sobre "qu{\'{e}} es justo". M{\'{a}}s bien, incluyen preguntas sobre cu{\'{a}}n injusto es este o aquel aspecto de la realidad social y sobre las respuestas de individuos y grupos al grado de injusticia observado.
 
Quiero sugerir que, antes de que pueda haber alguna precisi{\'{o}}n en la determinaci{\'{o}}n
de las respuestas a los dos tipos de injusticia, debe haber medidas precisas de las magnitudes de la injusticia y esa especificaci{\'{o}}n inequ{\'{i}}voca de la funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia es el trabajo inmediato y esencial que tenemos ante nosotros. Este documento inicia ese trabajo. Informa de una nueva especificaci{\'{o}}n cuantitativa de
el sentido de la justicia y de la injusticia en lo que respecta a la distribuci{\'{o}}n de los ingresos laborales. La especificaci{\'{o}}n que considero correcta fue inducida a partir de amplios rean{\'{a}}lisis de los datos de la encuesta recogida por Jasso y Rossi (1977). Sus numerosos m{\'{e}}ritos la convierten inmediatamente en candidata a una Ley universal de Evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la Justicia en todas las cuestiones distributivas
 
Secci{\'{o}}n libre de apuntes:
 
Jasso comienza haciendo la distinci{\'{o}}n entre la agenda normtiva de justicia y la agenda emp{\'{i}}rica.
 
En la dimensi{\'{o}}n emp{\'{i}}rica la autora se{\~{n}}ala lo siguiente:
 
"La versi{\'{o}}n cient{\'{i}}fica del problema busca, m{\'{a}}s bien, responder a tres preguntas:

(1) ¿Qu{\'{e}} cree la gente que es justo?

(2) ¿Los individuos distinguen grados de injusticia y, de ser as{\'{i}}, c{\'{o}}mo se relacionan con las desviaciones de la justicia perfecta?

(3) ¿Cu{\'{a}}l es la respuesta conductual a la injusticia? Este es un problema de {\'{e}}tica descriptiva o, en terminolog{\'{i}}a m{\'{a}}s moderna, de explicaci{\'{o}}n cient{\'{i}}fica."
 
Adem{\'{a}}s, se{\~{n}}ala que:
 
"Este documento se centra en la segunda cuesti{\'{o}}n. Se pregunta por la sensaci{\'{o}}n de injusticia que acompa{\~{n}}a a las desviaciones del orden justo. ¿Existen magni- tudes de injusticia? ¿Se piensa que la infra-recompensa es m{\'{a}}s injusta que la sobre-recompensa? ¿Cu{\'{a}}l es la relaci{\'{o}}n precisa entre la recompensa justa y la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia? Hasta que no se responda a estas preguntas, la b{\'{u}}squeda de respuestas a la injusticia no podr{\'{a}} dar resultados cuantificados y precisos"
 
Jasso comienza dandp las siguientes definiciones:
 
e utilizan los siguientes t{\'{e}}rminos:

1. Observador.- Es la persona que hace los juicios sobre la justicia o injusticia de las ganancias recibidas por cualquier asalariado, incluido {\'{e}}l mismo.

2. Solo ganancias.-Esta es la cantidad global que el observador considera solo para una fuente de ingresos determinada. El t{\'{e}}rmino carece de contenido ontol{\'{o}}gico; s{\'{o}}lo representa el juicio del observador, cualquiera que sea. Por ejemplo, el observador puede juzgar que las ganancias de una estrella de cine son solo $ 25,000 al a{\~{n}}o y para el presidente de una corporaci{\'{o}}n $ 100,000 o que solo las ganancias para todos los que ganan son $ 8,000 al a{\~{n}}o.

3. Ingresos reales.-Estos son los ingresos anuales reales recibidos por cualquier fuente de ingresos dada.

4. Justicia.-Esta es la condici{\'{o}}n cuando las ganancias justas de un individuo
exactamente igual a sus ganancias reales.

5. Injusticia.-Esta es la condici{\'{o}}n en la que las ganancias justas de un individuo y los ingresos reales son desiguales. La injusticia es de dos tipos: (a) recompensa injusta: el caso en que las ganancias solo exceden las ganancias reales y (b) recompensa excesiva injusta: el caso en que las ganancias reales exceden solo las ganancias."
 
En lo que sigue se dedica a determinar una correcta Ley de Evaluaci{\'{o}}n de justicia, se{\~{n}}alando:
 
"Una funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia adecuada debe predecir exactamente c{\'{o}}mo cambiar{\'{a}} la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia cuando cambien los dos t{\'{e}}rminos, los ingresos reales y los ingresos justos"
 
"El valor de la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia debe ser significativo, independientemente
del bien considerado. Es decir, la justicia y la injusticia deben expresarse en algunas unidades de justicia significativas, aunque no fundamentales, de manera que un determinado valor de la escala signifique siempre lo mismo, por ejemplo, una injusticia extrema del tipo de la recompensa excesiva o la justicia perfecta"
 
Formulas para la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de justicia en la literatura:
 
￼
 
 
Criticas que le hace: Si bien es poco ambigua, tiene dos debilidades.
 
Citas:
En primer lugar, no puede especificar el tipo de injusticia que resulta cuando las proporciones no son iguales; no tenemos forma de saber si una persona est{\'{a}} infra-recompensada o la otra sobre-recompensada.
 
En segundo lugar, la formulaci{\'{o}}n de Homans no puede hacer frente a la posibilidad de que tanto A como B sean recompensados injustamente (es decir, que ambos sean igualmente infra-recompensados o igualmente sobre-recompensados).
 
Por lo tanto, la proposici{\'{o}}n de Homans no sirve para especificar el sentido de la injusticia e incluso puede ser totalmente err{\'{o}}nea en la predicci{\'{o}}n de la justicia
 
￼
 
Criticas que le hace: Seg{\'{u}}n Jasso, esta formulaci{\'{o}}n tambi{\'{e}}n es inequivoca y correcta. Sin embargo, tambi{\'{e}}n cuenta con debilidades:
 
1) La funci{\'{o}}n es dependiente de la unidad de la recompensa
 
"
Pero la propuesta de Berger et al. tiene una gran debilidad. Siempre que la recompensa real y la recompensa justa no sean iguales, es decir, siempre que el proceso de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia d{\'{e}} como resultado un sentido de injusticia, el valor de la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia aparece en las unidades de recompensa y no en unidades de justicia significativas. Es decir, lo que deber{\'{i}}a ser una magnitud de injusticia es, en cambio, una magnitud positiva o negativa del bien cuya distribuci{\'{o}}n se est{\'{a}} evaluando. Si, digamos, las ganancias reales son de $ 10,000 y solo las ganancias son de $ 8,000, la evaluaci{\'{o}}n judicial es igual a $ 2,000"
 
2) La subrecompensa y la sobrerecompensa valen lo mismo.

"Adem{\'{a}}s, existe una debilidad adicional en la f{\'{o}}rmula de Berger et al. Siempre que las diferencias absolutas entre los ingresos reales y los ingresos justos sean iguales, la "injusticia", aunque en unidades incorrectas, es igual. Y este resultado parece violar la experiencia humana de que la deficiencia se considera m{\'{a}}s injusta que un exceso comparable."
 
￼
 
 
￼
 
Criticas a la variaci{\'{o}}n de Waltser:
 
"En primer lugar, no puede tratar adecuadamente las situaciones en las que ambas partes (o todas) son recompensadas injustamente. Puesto que han definido la equidad como igualdad de resultados relativos, tienen que seguir llam{\'{a}}ndola equidad cuando los participantes tienen puntuaciones de resultados relativos iguales, ya sean negativas o positivas.
 
Un segundo punto d{\'{e}}bil es que es excesivamente complicado, como indican los signos ad hoc de los exponentes"
 
Adem{\'{a}}s, cae en las mismas debilidades que la formula de Berger et al.
 
￼
 
Lo bueno de esta formula es que 1) trabaja con unidades de justicia; 2) que produce una evaluaci{\'{o}}n de justicia inequivoca (el cero siempre es justicia, negativo siempre es subrecompensa y positivo sobrerecompensa) y 3) al incporporar un termino cuadradito la magnitud abosoluta es mayor en la subrecompena que en la sobrerecompensas
 
Sus debilidades son las siguientes (citas)
 
*Primera debilidad de la ex-formula de Jasso*

Pero se ve empa{\~{n}}ado por varias dificultades importantes. Primero, la mejor ecuaci{\'{o}}n Jasso y Rossi pudieron ajustarse a los datos de forma aditiva con una sola no linealidad en las ganancias reales, una no linealidad que representaron mediante la inclusi{\'{o}}n de un t{\'{e}}rmino lineal y cuadr{\'{a}}tico para las ganancias. No investigaron la posibilidad de que la no linealidad pudiera representarse m{\'{a}}s fielmente de otras formas.
 
*Segunda debilidad de la ex-formula de Jasso y Rossi*

En segundo lugar, la f{\'{o}}rmula de Jasso y Rossi, al hacer que los coeficientes de regresi{\'{o}}n de suma importancia, es v{\'{a}}lido para un solo punto espacio-temporal. Sin los coeficientes de regresi{\'{o}}n, no es posible predecir la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia. Dado que las pendientes estiman el valor de reclamos particulares sobre bienes particulares en un contexto hist{\'{o}}rico particular, son cantidades ad hoc que no aclaran ning{\'{u}}n proceso de justicia general (te{\'{o}}rico).
 
*Tercera debilidad de la ex-formula de Jasso*


En tercer lugar, la f{\'{o}}rmula de Jasso y Rossi se complica indebidamente por su dependencia de coeficientes de regresi{\'{o}}n y t{\'{e}}rminos cuadr{\'{a}}ticos, como el de Walster et al., Mediante el uso de exponentes ad hoc; De hecho, ambos recuerdan el feliz desove de los epiciclos que caracterizaron la astronom{\'{i}}a pre-kepleriana.
 
Method
 
Una de las principales tareas de este documento es describir los an{\'{a}}lisis emp{\'{i}}ricos que dieron lugar a la nueva especificaci{\'{o}}n de la funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia. En esta secci{\'{o}}n describo primero el conjunto de datos y luego los an{\'{a}}lisis matem{\'{a}}ticos
 
Findings
 
Por lo tanto, los gr{\'{a}}ficos de los datos originales proporcionaron una pista importante en mi
buscar el "verdadero" funci{\'{o}}n de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia subyacente: la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia es una funci{\'{o}}n lineal del logaritmo de los ingresos reales
 
Esto significa que la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia es una funci{\'{o}}n logar{\'{i}}tmica del
relaci{\'{o}}n entre los ingresos reales y los ingresos justos o, alternativamente, una funci{\'{o}}n de la diferencia con signo entre los logaritmos de los ingresos reales y de los ingresos justos. Esta f{\'{o}}rmula produce una evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la justicia en unidades de justicia significativas, y cuantifica la experiencia humana de que la deficiencia se siente m{\'{a}}s intensamente que el exceso.
 
En otras palabras, cuando un observador juzga la equidad o injusticia de las ganancias de un individuo, la operaci{\'{o}}n mental implica un procedimiento de proporci{\'{o}}n. Se recupera o se forma r{\'{a}}pidamente una imagen mental de lo que ser{\'{i}}an los ingresos justos para esa persona, se hace una relaci{\'{o}}n entre los ingresos reales y la cantidad justa, y "algo" que puede representarse formalmente mediante un logaritmo tomado del cociente.
 
## OJO:

La primera pregunta de Jasso sobre lo qu{\'{e}} la gente percibe como justo tiene que ver con la discusi{\'{o}}n de si la gente utiliza los estandares utopicos o existenciales.

"Creo que hemos cumplido con la segunda de las tareas necesarias para una
teor{\'{i}}a de la justicia distributiva. Ahora hay que seguir trabajando en los otros dos. Con respecto a la primera, creo que las l{\'{i}}neas argumentales han sido bien dibujado por Homans y Berger et al: ¿Son las nociones de las personas sobre "lo que es justo" formado por referencia a "lo que es" o a "lo que deber{\'{i}}a ser"? En el transcurso de la vida cotidiana, he observado el funcionamiento de ambos criterios, el existencial y el ut{\'{o}}pico, por lo que sugiero que la cuesti{\'{o}}n puede plantearse m{\'{a}}s fruct{\'{i}}feramente de la siguiente manera: ¿Qu{\'{e}} explica la variabilidad observada en la formaci{\'{o}}n de los individuos del t{\'{e}}rmino justo"},

@article{Wegener1991,
abstract = {In social justice research, evidence shows that-in western societies-a majority of the population considers their shares of material goods as just. A number of largely psychologically oriented models have been proposed to explain this astonishing finding. This paper goes beyond these statements, first, by asking why a minority of individuals are convinced of being treated unjustly and, second, by reflecting on structural antecedent conditions for judgments of injustice. Considering that occupational careers are shaped by institutional distribution systems to varying degrees, it is proposed that patterns of social mobility determine feelings of injustice. Based on a theory of rational investments and expected returns, four different types of mobility patterns are distinguished, and predictions are made as to how these patterns affect justice evaluations. Data from a life history study are used to test these predictions. It is concluded that feelings of injustice are not so much a matter of personal values but rather reactions to structural facts. {\textcopyright} 1991 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Relative deprivation (RD) is the judgment that one or one's ingroup is worse off compared with some relevant standard coupled with feelings of dissatisfaction, anger, and resentment. RD predicts a wide range of outcomes, but it is unclear whether this relationship is moderated by national cultural differences. Therefore, in the first study, we used national assessments of individual-collectivism and power distance to code 303 effect sizes from 31 different countries with 200,578 participants. RD predicted outcomes ranging from life satisfaction to collective action more strongly within individualistic nations. A second survey of 6,112 undergraduate university students from 28 different countries confirmed the predictive value of RD. Again, the relationship between individual RD and different outcomes was stronger for students who lived in more individualistic countries. Group-based RD also predicted political trust more strongly for students who lived in countries marked by lower power distance. RD effects, although consistent predictors, are culturally bounded. In particular, RD is more likely to motivate reactions within individualistic countries that emphasize individual agency and achievement as a source of self-worth.},

@article{Jasso2009,
abstract = {This paper proposes a new model of wage determination and wage inequality. In this model, wage-setters set workers' wages; they do so either directly, as when individuals vote in a salary committee, or indirectly, as when political parties, via the myriad of social, economic, fiscal, and other policies, generate wages. The recommendations made by wage-setters (or arising from their policies) form a distribution, and all the wage-setter-specific distributions are combined into a single final wage distribution. There may be any number of wage-setters; some wage-setters count more than others; and the wage-setters may differ among themselves on both the wage distribution and the amounts recommended for particular workers. We use probability theory to derive initial results, including both distribution-independent and distribution-specific results. Fortuitously, elements of the model correspond to basic democratic principles. Thus, the model yields implications for the effects of democracy on wage inequality. These include: (1) the effects of the number of wage-setters and their power depend on the configuration of agreements and disagreements; (2) independence of mind reduces wage inequality, and dissent does so even more; (3) when leaders of democratic nations seek to forge an economic consensus, they are unwittingly inducing greater economic inequality; (4) arguments for independent thinking will be more vigorous in small societies than in large societies; (5) given a fixed distributional form for wages and two political parties which either ignore or oppose each other's distributional ideas, the closer the party split to 50ĝ€"50, the lower the wage inequality; and (6) under certain conditions the wage distribution within wage-setting context will be normal, but the normality will be obscured, as cross-context mixtures will display a wide variety of shapes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {This study explores how citizens in Spain perceive different tactics employed in anti-austerity protests in 2011–2013, and tests the model of the process of justification of protest. This model combines the elements of Gamson's collective action frames theory (effectiveness, anger and grievances, operationalized as appraisal of harm) with the concept of legitimacy. It also links justification to the intention to participate. We empirically differentiate between three protest tactics: normative demonstrations, non-normative peaceful strategies, and non-normative violent actions. We find that demonstrations are perceived to be more legitimate, but less effective than non-normative peaceful protests. Violent strategies, on the other hand, are seen to be more effective than legitimate. We postulate and find that legitimacy and effectiveness partially or fully mediate the impact of political ideology, anger, and appraisal of harm on the probability of participation in non-normative protest. Finally, we establish meaningful differences in the predictors of the likelihood of joining normative, non-normative peaceful, or non-normative violent protests. Overall, our results suggest that the study of justification of collective action and especially, the inclusion of the notion of legitimacy, enriches our understanding of the popular approval of and propensity to participate in different forms of collective protest.},

Determinants of beliefs about poverty, distributive justice, class identification, and class images and class consciousness are presented, and the consequences of beliefs about economic inequality are reviewed. Limitations of stratification studies and the need for multivariate analysis models and useful statistical methods for investigating beliefs are assessed.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which police legitimacy and social identity explain variation in public acceptance of police use of force. The authors assess whether there is an association between legitimacy and public acceptance of apparently illegal or unethical police action; and the extent to which identification with a particular social group predicts judgments of police behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The study draws upon cross-sectional data from a 2015 survey of a representative sample of adults in England and Wales. Structural equation modeling is used to model conditional correlations between latent constructs. Findings: There are two main findings. First, identifying more strongly with a social group that the police may be seen to represent was consistently associated with greater acceptance of police use of force, whether or not that force seemed to be justified. Second, beliefs about the legitimacy of the police were also associated with acceptance, but primarily only in relation to the use of force in situations where it appeared prima facie justifiable. Social implications: Results suggest one possible set of reasons why police retain public support in the face of scandals concerning excessive use of force. Originality/value: This is one of only very few studies that have used survey data to explore lay justifications for police use of force.},

Research supporting this model has, however, focused entirely on relatively normative actions such as participating in demonstrations. We argue that the relations between emotions, efficacy, and action differ for more extreme, nonnormative actions and propose (a) that nonnormative actions are often driven by a sense of low efficacy and (b) that contempt, which, unlike anger, entails psychological distancing and a lack of reconciliatory intentions, predicts nonnormative action.

Results were generally supportive of predictions and indicated that (a) anger was strongly related to normative action but overall unrelated or less strongly related to nonnormative action, (b) contempt was either unrelated or negatively related to normative action but significantly positively predicted nonnormative action, and (c) efficacy was positively related to normative action and negatively related to nonnormative action.

This study examined associations between perpetration or victimization and attitudes toward IPV with data from a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an HIV prevention intervention among school students in three sites in South Africa and Tanzania. Data analyses were confined to students from the control group only, and to those with experience with romantic relationships. Boys and those more involved with violence reported more violence-supportive attitudes. For Cape Town (and to some extent Mankweng), the results of prospective prediction are consistent with the notion of a bidirectional attitudes–behavior interrelationship. For Dar es Salaam attitudes predicted behavior prospectively; however, prediction in the opposite direction was not confirmed. These results indicate that attitude change strategies may be useful complementary to structural approaches also in global South settings, although their effectiveness may vary.},

In this article, we argue that the violent group itself, and the identity it bestows on participating members, is an often overlooked and yet fundamental source of motivation for an individual's participation in collective violence. Reviewing insights from social and moral psychology, military history, and public health, we outline how the psychology of individual violent behavior presents a puzzle. For an ordinary person, participation in violence is often an aversive and distressing experience, and yet violent behavior leads to more violence in the future. A better understanding of the dynamics of collective violence allows us to make sense of this paradox. Violent groups can promote violent behavior among members by increasing members' motivation to engage in violence, particularly through group identification and deliberate strategies, and by removing psychological obstacles to violence (i.e., by making violence less aversive). Our synthesis ofthe literature points to a cycle ofindividuals' participation in collective violence, in which group identification motivates violent behavior and violent behavior increases identification with violent groups.},

abstract = {Background/Objective: Both theoretical proposals and empirical work point to a common concurrence between attitudes toward school violence and violent behavior. Studies often address this issue superficially or within intervention programs. Our objective is to describe the results of a systematic review and to conduct a meta-analysis exploring these associations. Method: A systematic review was conducted in the main databases. Effect sizes were calculated and synthesized using random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the relationship between attitudes toward violence and school violence. A meta-regression was performed for the moderator analysis of sex and age. Results: The literature search strategy produced 12,293 articles. The review process produced a final result of 23 studies. Our results estimate a significant positive relationship (r =.368 p < .001; 95% CI [.323, .412]) between attitudes toward violence and school violence in children and adolescents. Conclusions: This study allows us to quantify with an adequate degree of specificity the attitude-behavior relationship in the school context. These results may facilitate future researchers to design programs that address this specificity in order to improve school climate. More research is needed using validated instruments to further specify the type of attitudes that have the greatest influence on the manifestation of school violence.},

abstract = {The present review identifies a variety of tactics that are often employed by ideologies to promote and/or justify political violence. The review builds on a social psychological framework that identifies important existential and epistemic needs that motivate individuals to become ideological extremists and discusses the mechanisms through which ideological narratives that promote political violence can serve these needs. We end the review by discussing two broad variants of ideology (religious and conservative) that should be particularly apt at implementing these tactics.},

abstract = {This paper investigates relationships between actual occupational\nincomes, perceived incomes and legitimate incomes. It is based on\ntwo Australian national surveys (N = 1000) conducted in 1988. Results\nindicate that the public believes that incomes ought to be much more\nequal than they currently are. There is support both for increasing\nlow incomes and decreasing high incomes. However the public systematically\nmisperceives the income distribution and erroneously believes that\nthere is virtually no difference between legitimate incomes and actual\nincomes. The main implications for an empirically sound theory of\ndistributive justice are that: (1) it is incorrect to assume that\npublic perceptions of the distribution of social goods are even remotely\naccurate and (2) a normative standard of equality distorts perceptions\nof distributive outcomes. Perceptions of justice determine perceptions\nof fact rather than vice-versa.},

@article{Smith2012,
abstract = {Relative deprivation (RD) is the judgment that one is worse off compared to some standard accompanied by feelings of anger and resentment. Social scientists use RD to predict a wide range of significant outcome variables: collective action, individual achievement and deviance, intergroup attitudes, and physical and mental health. But the results are often weak and inconsistent. The authors draw on a theoretical and meta-analytic review (210 studies composing 293 independent samples, 421 tests, and 186,073 respondents) to present a model that integrates group and individual RD. RD measures that (a) include justice-related affect, (b) match the outcome level of analysis, and (c) use higher quality measures yield significantly stronger relationships. Future research should focus on appropriate RD measurement, angry resentment, and the inclusion of theoretically relevant situational appraisals. Such methodological improvements would revitalize RD as a useful social psychological predictor of a wide range of important individual and social processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.},

abstract = {This paper develops a framework for assessing interindividual and intergroup differences in the sense of justice. The framework enables estimation of all the justice quantities of interest - the principles of microjustice and macrojustice, the style of expression, and the firmness with which the principles of microjustice are held - as well as statistical testing for cross-individual and cross-group differences. To illustrate the framework, the paper investigates gender differences in the principles of justice with respect to earnings. Using data collected by Rossi′s factorial-survey method, we obtain respondent-specific estimates of (i) three principles of microjustice - the just base wage, the just rate of return to schooling, and the just gender multiplier-and the certitude with which they are held; and (ii) the principles of macrojustice - represented by seven measures of inequality. To assess gender differences in each of these eleven elements, we estimate a variety of models, utilizing ordinary least-squares estimators and, to correct for possible heteroskedasticity and endogeneity, generalized least-squares and two-stage/least-squares estimators; for the three estimated principles of microjustice, we also carry out hierarchical empirical-Bayes analyses. {\textcopyright} 1994 Academic Press.
